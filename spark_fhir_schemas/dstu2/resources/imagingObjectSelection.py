        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            uid: Instance UID of the DICOM KOS SOP Instances represented in this resource.
            patient: A patient resource reference which is the patient subject of all DICOM SOP
        Instances in this ImagingObjectSelection.
            title: The reason for, or significance of, the selection of objects referenced in the
        resource.
            description: Text description of the DICOM SOP instances selected in the
        ImagingObjectSelection. This should be aligned with the content of the title
        element, and can provide further explanation of the SOP instances in the
        selection.
            author: Author of ImagingObjectSelection. It can be a human author or a device which
        made the decision of the SOP instances selected. For example, a radiologist
        selected a set of imaging SOP instances to attach in a diagnostic report, and
        a CAD application may author a selection to describe SOP instances it used to
        generate a detection conclusion.
            authoringTime: Date and time when the selection of the referenced instances were made. It is
        (typically) different from the creation date of the selection resource, and
        from dates associated with the referenced instances (e.g. capture time of the
        referenced image).
            study: Study identity and locating information of the DICOM SOP instances in the
        selection.
