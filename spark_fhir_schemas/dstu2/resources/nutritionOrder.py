            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            patient: The person (patient) who needs the nutrition order for an oral diet,
        nutritional supplement and/or enteral or formula feeding.
            orderer: The practitioner that holds legal responsibility for ordering the diet,
        nutritional supplement, or formula feedings.
            identifier: Identifiers assigned to this order by the order sender or by the order
        receiver.
            encounter: An encounter that provides additional information about the healthcare context
        in which this request is made.
            dateTime: The date and time that this nutrition order was requested.
            status: The workflow status of the nutrition order/request.
            allergyIntolerance: A link to a record of allergies or intolerances  which should be included in
        the nutrition order.
            foodPreferenceModifier: This modifier is used to convey order-specific modifiers about the type of
        food that should be given. These can be derived from patient allergies,
        intolerances, or preferences such as Halal, Vegan or Kosher. This modifier
        applies to the entire nutrition order inclusive of the oral diet, nutritional
        supplements and enteral formula feedings.
            excludeFoodModifier: This modifier is used to convey order-specific modifiers about the type of
        food that should NOT be given. These can be derived from patient allergies,
        intolerances, or preferences such as No Red Meat, No Soy or No Wheat or
        Gluten-Free.  While it should not be necessary to repeat allergy or
        intolerance information captured in the referenced allergyIntolerance resource
        in the excludeFoodModifier, this element may be used to convey additional
        specificity related to foods that should be eliminated from the patientâ€™s diet
        for any reason.  This modifier applies to the entire nutrition order inclusive
        of the oral diet, nutritional supplements and enteral formula feedings.
            oralDiet: Diet given orally in contrast to enteral (tube) feeding.
            supplement: Oral nutritional products given in order to add further nutritional value to
        the patient's diet.
            enteralFormula: Feeding provided through the gastrointestinal tract via a tube, catheter, or
        stoma that delivers nutrition distal to the oral cavity.
