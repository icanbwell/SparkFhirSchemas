        A conformance statement is a set of capabilities of a FHIR Server that may be
        used as a statement of actual server functionality or a statement of required
        or desired server implementation.
        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            url: An absolute URL that is used to identify this conformance statement when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
        URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this
        conformance statement is (or will be) published.
            version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the conformance
        statement when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
        This is an arbitrary value managed by the profile author manually and the
        value should be a timestamp.
            name: A free text natural language name identifying the conformance statement.
            status: The status of this conformance statement.
            experimental: A flag to indicate that this conformance statement is authored for testing
        purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
        for genuine usage.
            publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the conformance.
            contact: Contacts to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher.
            date: The date  (and optionally time) when the conformance statement was published.
        The date must change when the business version changes, if it does, and it
        must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
        substantive content of the conformance statement changes.
            description: A free text natural language description of the conformance statement and its
        use. Typically, this is used when the conformance statement describes a
        desired rather than an actual solution, for example as a formal expression of
        requirements as part of an RFP.
            requirements: Explains why this conformance statement is needed and why it's been
        constrained as it has.
            copyright: A copyright statement relating to the conformance statement and/or its
        contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the details of the system described by the conformance
        statement.
            kind: The way that this statement is intended to be used, to describe an actual
        running instance of software, a particular product (kind not instance of
        software) or a class of implementation (e.g. a desired purchase).
            software: Software that is covered by this conformance statement.  It is used when the
        conformance statement describes the capabilities of a particular software
        version, independent of an installation.
            implementation: Identifies a specific implementation instance that is described by the
        conformance statement - i.e. a particular installation, rather than the
        capabilities of a software program.
            fhirVersion: The version of the FHIR specification on which this conformance statement is
        based.
            acceptUnknown: A code that indicates whether the application accepts unknown elements or
        extensions when reading resources.
            format: A list of the formats supported by this implementation using their content
        types.
            profile: A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system.
        For a server, "supported by the system" means the system hosts/produces a set
        of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients
        that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate
        data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and
        process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further
        discussion in [Using Profiles]{profiling.html#profile-uses}.
            rest: A definition of the restful capabilities of the solution, if any.
            messaging: A description of the messaging capabilities of the solution.
            document: A document definition.
