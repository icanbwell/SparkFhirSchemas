        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: This records identifiers associated with this family member history record
        that are defined by business processes and/ or used to refer to it when a
        direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA
        documents, or in written / printed documentation).
            patient: The person who this history concerns.
            date: The date (and possibly time) when the family member history was taken.
            status: A code specifying a state of a Family Member History record.
            name: This will either be a name or a description; e.g. "Aunt Susan", "my cousin
        with the red hair".
            relationship: The type of relationship this person has to the patient (father, mother,
        brother etc.).
            gender: Administrative Gender - the gender that the relative is considered to have for
        administration and record keeping purposes.
            bornPeriod: None
            bornDate: None
            bornString: None

            note: This property allows a non condition-specific note to the made about the
        related person. Ideally, the note would be in the condition property, but this
        is not always possible.
            condition: The significant Conditions (or condition) that the family member had. This is
        a repeating section to allow a system to represent more than one condition per
        resource, though there is nothing stopping multiple resources - one per
        condition.
