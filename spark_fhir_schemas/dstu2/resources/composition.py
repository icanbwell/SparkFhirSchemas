        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: Logical identifier for the composition, assigned when created. This identifier
        stays constant as the composition is changed over time.
            date: The composition editing time, when the composition was last logically changed
        by the author.
            type: Specifies the particular kind of composition (e.g. History and Physical,
        Discharge Summary, Progress Note). This usually equates to the purpose of
        making the composition.
            class: A categorization for the type of the composition - helps for indexing and
        searching. This may be implied by or derived from the code specified in the
        Composition Type.
            title: Official human-readable label for the composition.
            status: The workflow/clinical status of this composition. The status is a marker for
        the clinical standing of the document.
            confidentiality: The code specifying the level of confidentiality of the Composition.
            subject: Who or what the composition is about. The composition can be about a person,
        (patient or healthcare practitioner), a device (e.g. a machine) or even a
        group of subjects (such as a document about a herd of livestock, or a set of
        patients that share a common exposure).
            author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in the composition, not
        necessarily who typed it in.
            attester: A participant who has attested to the accuracy of the composition/document.
            custodian: Identifies the organization or group who is responsible for ongoing
        maintenance of and access to the composition/document information.
            event: The clinical service, such as a colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being
        documented.
            encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care this documentation is
        associated with.
            section: The root of the sections that make up the composition.
