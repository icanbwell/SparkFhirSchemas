            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once

            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.

        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.
            status: Indicates the current status of the vaccination event.
            date: Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.
            vaccineCode: Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.
            patient: The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.
            wasNotGiven: Indicates if the vaccination was or was not given.
            reported: True if this administration was reported rather than directly administered.
            performer: Clinician who administered the vaccine.
            requester: Clinician who ordered the vaccination.
            encounter: The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care
        provider the immunization was performed as part of.
            manufacturer: Name of vaccine manufacturer.
            location: The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.
            lotNumber: Lot number of the  vaccine product.
            expirationDate: Date vaccine batch expires.
            site: Body site where vaccine was administered.
            route: The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.
            doseQuantity: The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.
            note: Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other
        attributes.
            explanation: Reasons why a vaccine was or was not administered.
            reaction: Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an
        immunization.
