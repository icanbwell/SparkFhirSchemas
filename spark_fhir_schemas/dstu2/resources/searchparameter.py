        search/filter on a resource.
        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            url: An absolute URL that is used to identify this search parameter when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
        URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this search
        parameter is (or will be) published.
            name: A free text natural language name identifying the search parameter.
            status: The status of this search parameter definition.
            experimental: A flag to indicate that this search parameter definition is authored for
        testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to
        be used for genuine usage.
            publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the search
        parameter.
            contact: Contacts to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher.
            date: The date  (and optionally time) when the search parameter definition was
        published. The date must change when the business version changes, if it does,
        and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change
        when the substantive content of the search parameter changes.
            requirements: The Scope and Usage that this search parameter was created to meet.
            code: The code used in the URL or the parameter name in a parameters resource for
        this search parameter.
            base: The base resource type that this search parameter refers to.
            type: The type of value a search parameter refers to, and how the content is
        interpreted.
            description: A description of the search parameters and how it used.
            xpath: An XPath expression that returns a set of elements for the search parameter.
            xpathUsage: How the search parameter relates to the set of elements returned by evaluating
        the xpath query.
            target: Types of resource (if a resource is referenced).
