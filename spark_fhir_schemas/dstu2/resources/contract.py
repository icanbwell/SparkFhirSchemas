            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: Unique identifier for this Contract.
            issued: When this  Contract was issued.
            applies: Relevant time or time-period when this Contract is applicable.

        valued items such as goods and services.
            authority: A formally or informally recognized grouping of people, principals,

            domain: Recognized governance framework or system operating with a circumscribed scope
        in accordance with specified principles, policies, processes or procedures for
        managing rights, actions, or behaviors of parties or principals relative to
        resources.
            type: Type of Contract such as an insurance policy, real estate contract, a will,
        power of attorny, Privacy or Security policy , trust framework agreement, etc.
            subType: More specific type or specialization of an overarching or more general
        contract such as auto insurance, home owner  insurance, prenupial agreement,
        Advanced-Directive, or privacy consent.
            action: Action stipulated by this Contract.
            actionReason: Reason for action stipulated by this Contract.

            bindingReference: None
            friendly: The "patient friendly language" versionof the Contract in whole or in parts.
        "Patient friendly language" means the representation of the Contract and
        Contract Provisions in a manner that is readily accessible and understandable
