        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            url: An absolute URL that is used to identify this operation definition when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
        URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this
        operation definition is (or will be) published.
            version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the profile when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary
        value managed by the profile author manually and the value should be a
        timestamp.
            name: A free text natural language name identifying the operation.
            status: The status of the profile.
            kind: Whether this is an operation or a named query.
            experimental: This profile was authored for testing purposes (or
        education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used for genuine
        usage.
            publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the operation
        definition.
            contact: Contacts to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher.
            date: The date this version of the operation definition was published. The date must
        change when the business version changes, if it does, and it must change if
        the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the Operation Definition changes.
            description: A free text natural language description of the profile and its use.
            requirements: Explains why this operation definition is needed and why it's been constrained
        as it has.
            idempotent: Operations that are idempotent (see [HTTP specification definition of
        idempotent](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html)) may be
        invoked by performing an HTTP GET operation instead of a POST.
            code: The name used to invoke the operation.
            notes: Additional information about how to use this operation or named query.
            base: Indicates that this operation definition is a constraining profile on the
        base.
            system: Indicates whether this operation or named query can be invoked at the system
        level (e.g. without needing to choose a resource type for the context).
            type: Indicates whether this operation or named query can be invoked at the resource
        type level for any given resource type level (e.g. without needing to choose a
        resource type for the context).
            instance: Indicates whether this operation can be invoked on a particular instance of
        one of the given types.
            parameter: The parameters for the operation/query.
