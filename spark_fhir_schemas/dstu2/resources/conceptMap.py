        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            url: An absolute URL that is used to identify this concept map when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
        URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this concept
        map is (or will be) published.
            identifier: Formal identifier that is used to identify this concept map when it is
        represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
        or an instance.
            version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the concept map when
        it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
        arbitrary value managed by the profile author manually and the value should be
        a timestamp.
            name: A free text natural language name describing the concept map.
            status: The status of the concept map.
            experimental: This ConceptMap was authored for testing purposes (or
        education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used for genuine
        usage.
            publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the concept map.
            contact: Contacts to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher.
            date: The date this version of the concept map was published. The date must change
        when the business version changes, if it does, and it must change if the
        status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the concept map changes.
            description: A free text natural language description of the use of the concept map -
        reason for definition, conditions of use, etc.
            useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
        of concept map instances.
            requirements: Explains why this concept map is needed and why it has been constrained as it
        has.
            copyright: A copyright statement relating to the concept map and/or its contents.
