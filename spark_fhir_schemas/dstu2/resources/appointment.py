            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: This records identifiers associated with this appointment concern that are
        defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL
        reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or
        in written / printed documentation).
            status: The overall status of the Appointment. Each of the participants has their own
        participation status which indicates their involvement in the process, however
        this status indicates the shared status.
            type: The type of appointment that is being booked (This may also be associated with
        participants for location, and/or a HealthcareService).
            reason: The reason that this appointment is being scheduled. This is more clinical
        than administrative.
            priority: The priority of the appointment. Can be used to make informed decisions if
        needing to re-prioritize appointments. (The iCal Standard specifies 0 as
        undefined, 1 as highest, 9 as lowest priority).
            description: The brief description of the appointment as would be shown on a subject line
        in a meeting request, or appointment list. Detailed or expanded information
        should be put in the comment field.
            start: Date/Time that the appointment is to take place.
            end: Date/Time that the appointment is to conclude.
            minutesDuration: Number of minutes that the appointment is to take. This can be less than the
        duration between the start and end times (where actual time of appointment is
        only an estimate or is a planned appointment request).
            slot: The slot that this appointment is filling. If provided then the schedule will
        not be provided as slots are not recursive, and the start/end values MUST be
        the same as from the slot.
            comment: Additional comments about the appointment.
            participant: List of participants involved in the appointment.
