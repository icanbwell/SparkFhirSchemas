            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            subject: Who or what the investigation is to be performed on. This is usually a human
        patient, but diagnostic tests can also be requested on animals, groups of
        humans or animals, devices such as dialysis machines, or even locations
        (typically for environmental scans).
            orderer: The practitioner that holds legal responsibility for ordering the
        investigation.
            identifier: Identifiers assigned to this order instance by the orderer and/or  the
        receiver and/or order fulfiller.
            encounter: An encounter that provides additional information about the healthcare context
        in which this request is made.
            reason: An explanation or justification for why this diagnostic investigation is being
        requested.   This is often for billing purposes.  May relate to the resources
        referred to in supportingInformation.
            supportingInformation: Additional clinical information about the patient or specimen that may
        influence test interpretations.  This includes observations explicitly
        requested by the producer(filler) to provide context or supporting information
        needed to complete the order.
            specimen: One or more specimens that the diagnostic investigation is about.
            status: The status of the order.
            priority: The clinical priority associated with this order.
            event: A summary of the events of interest that have occurred as the request is
        processed; e.g. when the order was made, various processing steps (specimens
        received), when it was completed.
            item: The specific diagnostic investigations that are requested as part of this
        request. Sometimes, there can only be one item per request, but in most
        contexts, more than one investigation can be requested.
            note: Any other notes associated with this patient, specimen or order (e.g. "patient
        hates needles").
