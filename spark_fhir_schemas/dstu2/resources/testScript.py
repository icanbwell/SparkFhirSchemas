        implementation to determine compliance against the FHIR specification.
        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            url: An absolute URL that is used to identify this Test Script. This SHALL be a
        URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this Test
        Script is (or will be) published.
            version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the TestScript. This
        is an arbitrary value managed by the TestScript author manually.
            name: A free text natural language name identifying the TestScript.
            status: The status of the TestScript.
            identifier: Identifier for the TestScript assigned for external purposes outside the
        context of FHIR.
            experimental: This TestScript was authored for testing purposes (or
        education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used for genuine
        usage.
            publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the Test Script.
            contact: Contacts to assist a user in finding and communicating with the publisher.
            date: The date this version of the test tcript was published. The date must change
        when the business version changes, if it does, and it must change if the
        status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the test cases change.
            description: A free text natural language description of the TestScript and its use.
            useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
        of Test Scripts.
            requirements: Explains why this Test Script is needed and why it's been constrained as it
        has.
            copyright: A copyright statement relating to the Test Script and/or its contents.
        Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the details of the constraints and mappings.
            metadata: The required capability must exist and are assumed to function correctly on
        the FHIR server being tested.
            multiserver: If the tests apply to more than one FHIR server (e.g. cross-server
        interoperability tests) then multiserver=true. Defaults to false if value is
        unspecified.
            fixture: Fixture in the test script - by reference (uri). All fixtures are required for
        the test script to execute.
            profile: Reference to the profile to be used for validation.
            variable: Variable is set based either on element value in response body or on header
        field value in the response headers.
            setup: A series of required setup operations before tests are executed.
            test: A test in this script.
            teardown: A series of operations required to clean up after the all the tests are
        executed (successfully or otherwise).
