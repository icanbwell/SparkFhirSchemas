        This resource provides the target, request and response, and action details
        for an action to be performed by the target on or about existing resources.
        If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions


            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            action: The type of processing action being requested, for example Reversal,
        Readjudication, StatusRequest,PendedRequest.
            identifier: The ProcessRequest business identifier.
            ruleset: The version of the style of resource contents. This should be mapped to the
        allowable profiles for this and supporting resources.
            originalRuleset: The style (standard) and version of the original material which was converted
        into this resource.
            created: The date when this resource was created.
            target: The organization which is the target of the request.
            provider: The practitioner who is responsible for the action specified in thise request.
            organization: The organization which is responsible for the action speccified in thise
        request.
            request: Reference of resource which is the target or subject of this action.
            response: Reference of a prior response to resource which is the target or subject of
        this action.
            nullify: If true remove all history excluding audit.
            reference: A reference to supply which authenticates the process.
            item: List of top level items to be re-adjudicated, if none specified then the
        entire submission is re-adjudicated.
            include: Names of resource types to include.
            exclude: Names of resource types to exclude.
            period: A period of time during which the fulfilling resources would have been
        created.
