            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            started: Date and Time the study started.
            patient: The patient imaged in the study.
            uid: Formal identifier for the study.
            accession: Accession Number is an identifier related to some aspect of imaging workflow
        and data management. Usage may vary across different institutions.  See for
        instance [IHE Radiology Technical Framework Volume 1 Appendix A](http://www.ih
        e.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_TF_Rev13.0_Vol1_FT_2014-07-30.
        pdf).
            identifier: Other identifiers for the study.
            order: A list of the diagnostic orders that resulted in this imaging study being
        performed.
            modalityList: A list of all the Series.ImageModality values that are actual acquisition
        modalities, i.e. those in the DICOM Context Group 29 (value set OID
        1.2.840.10008.6.1.19).
            referrer: The requesting/referring physician.
            availability: Availability of study (online, offline or nearline).
            url: WADO-RS resource where Study is available.
            numberOfSeries: Number of Series in Study.
            numberOfInstances: Number of SOP Instances in Study.
            procedure: Type of procedure performed.
            interpreter: Who read the study and interpreted the images or other content.
            description: Institution-generated description or classification of the Study performed.
            series: Each study has one or more series of images or other content.
