            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by organizations like
        manufacturers or owners. If the identifier identifies the type of device,
        Device.type should be used.
            type: Code or identifier to identify a kind of device.
            note: Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is
        not captured in an existing element.
            status: Status of the Device availability.
            manufacturer: A name of the manufacturer.
            model: The "model" is an identifier assigned by the manufacturer to identify the
        product by its type. This number is shared by the all devices sold as the same
        type.
            version: The version of the device, if the device has multiple releases under the same
        model, or if the device is software or carries firmware.
            manufactureDate: The date and time when the device was manufactured.
            expiry: The date and time beyond which this device is no longer valid or should not be
        used (if applicable).
            udi: United States Food and Drug Administration mandated Unique Device Identifier
        (UDI). Use the human readable information (the content that the user sees,
        which is sometimes different to the exact syntax represented in the barcode)
        - see http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDevi
        ceIdentification/default.htm.
            lotNumber: Lot number assigned by the manufacturer.
            owner: An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance
        of the device.
            location: The place where the device can be found.
            patient: Patient information, if the resource is affixed to a person.
            contact: Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible
        for the device.
            url: A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.
