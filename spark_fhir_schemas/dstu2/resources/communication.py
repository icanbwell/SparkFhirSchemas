            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            identifier: Identifiers associated with this Communication that are defined by business
        processes and/ or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to the
        resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written /
        printed documentation).
            category: The type of message conveyed such as alert, notification, reminder,
        instruction, etc.
            sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
        which was the source of the communication.
            recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
        which was the target of the communication. If receipts need to be tracked by
        individual, a separate resource instance will need to be created for each
        recipient. Â Multiple recipient communications are intended where either a
        receipt(s) is not tracked (e.g. a mass mail-out) or is captured in aggregate
        (all emails confirmed received by a particular time).
            payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) that was communicated to the recipient.
            medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).
            status: The status of the transmission.
            encounter: The encounter within which the communication was sent.
            sent: The time when this communication was sent.
            received: The time when this communication arrived at the destination.
            reason: The reason or justification for the communication.
            subject: The patient who was the focus of this communication.
            requestDetail: The communication request that was responsible for producing this
        communication.
