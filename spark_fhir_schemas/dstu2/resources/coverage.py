            id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
            language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict
        set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            issuer: The program or plan underwriter or payor.
            bin: Business Identification Number (BIN number) used to identify the routing  of
        eclaims if the insurer themselves don't have a BIN number for all of their
        business.
            period: Time period during which the coverage is in force. A missing start date
        indicates the start date isn't known, a missing end date means the coverage is
        continuing to be in force.
            type: The type of coverage: social program, medical plan, accident coverage (workers
        compensation, auto), group health.
            subscriberId: The id issued to the subscriber.
            identifier: The main (and possibly only) identifier for the coverage - often referred to
        as a Member Id, Subscriber Id, Certificate number or Personal Health Number or
        Case ID.
            group: Identifies a style or collective of coverage issues by the underwriter, for
        example may be used to identify a class of coverage or employer group. May
        also be referred to as a Policy or Group ID.
            plan: Identifies a style or collective of coverage issues by the underwriter, for
        example may be used to identify a class of coverage or employer group. May
        also be referred to as a Policy or Group ID.
            subPlan: Identifies a sub-style or sub-collective of coverage issues by the
        underwriter, for example may be used to identify a specific employer group
        within a class of employers. May be referred to as a Section or Division ID.
            dependent: A unique identifier for a dependent under the coverage.
            sequence: An optional counter for a particular instance of the identified coverage which
        increments upon each renewal.
            subscriber: The party who 'owns' the insurance contractual relationship to the policy or
        to whom the benefit of the policy is due.
            network: The identifier for a community of providers.
            contract: The policy(s) which constitute this insurance coverage.
