        definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

        the extension.

            type: Distinguishes between physical addresses (those you can visit) and mailing
        addresses (e.g. PO Boxes and care-of addresses). Most addresses are both.
            text: A full text representation of the address.

        street direction,  P.O. Box number, delivery hints, and similar address
        information.

            district: The name of the administrative area (county).
            state: Sub-unit of a country with limited sovereignty in a federally organized
        country. A code may be used if codes are in common use (i.e. US 2 letter state
        codes).
            postalCode: A postal code designating a region defined by the postal service.
            country: Country - a nation as commonly understood or generally accepted.
            period: Time period when address was/is in use.
