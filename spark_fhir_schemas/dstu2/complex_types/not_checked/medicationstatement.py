    A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A
    MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication
    now, or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication
    in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant
    other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario
    where this information is captured is during the history taking process during
    a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources
    such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of
    medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains

    The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication
    administration is that the medication administration has complete
    administration information and is based on actual administration information
    from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is
    often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the
    medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported
    the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity,
    or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less
    precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come
    from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
    medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication
    administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.

        resourceType: This is a MedicationStatement resource

        identifier: External identifier - FHIR will generate its own internal identifiers
            (probably URLs) which do not need to be explicitly managed by the resource.
            The identifier here is one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for
            example an automated medication pump would provide a record each time it
            operated; an administration while the patient was off the ward might be made
            with a different system and entered after the event.  Particularly important
            if these records have to be updated.

        basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.

        context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this
            MedicationStatement.

        status: A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of
            the medication used that this statement is about.  Generally this will be
            active or completed.

        category: Indicates where type of medication statement and where the medication is
            expected to be consumed or administered.

        medicationCodeableConcept: Identifies the medication being administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        medicationReference: Identifies the medication being administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        effectiveDateTime: The interval of time during which it is being asserted that the patient was
            taking the medication (or was not taking, when the wasNotGiven element is
            true).

        effectivePeriod: The interval of time during which it is being asserted that the patient was
            taking the medication (or was not taking, when the wasNotGiven element is
            true).

        dateAsserted: The date when the medication statement was asserted by the information source.

        informationSource: The person or organization that provided the information about the taking of
            this medication. Note: Use derivedFrom when a MedicationStatement is derived
            from other resources, e.g Claim or MedicationRequest.

        subject: The person, animal or group who is/was taking the medication.

        derivedFrom: Allows linking the MedicationStatement to the underlying MedicationRequest, or
            to other information that supports or is used to derive the
            MedicationStatement.

        taken: Indicator of the certainty of whether the medication was taken by the patient.

        reasonNotTaken: A code indicating why the medication was not taken.

        reasonCode: A reason for why the medication is being/was taken.

        reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication is being/was taken.

        note: Provides extra information about the medication statement that is not conveyed
            by the other attributes.

        dosage: Indicates how the medication is/was or should be taken by the patient.
