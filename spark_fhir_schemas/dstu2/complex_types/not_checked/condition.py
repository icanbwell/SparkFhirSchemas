        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this condition that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written /

        clinicalStatus: The clinical status of the condition.

        verificationStatus: The verification status to support the clinical status of the condition.

        category: A category assigned to the condition.

        severity: A subjective assessment of the severity of the condition as evaluated by the
            clinician.

        code: Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis.

        bodySite: The anatomical location where this condition manifests itself.

        subject: Indicates the patient or group who the condition record is associated with.

        context: Encounter during which the condition was first asserted.

        onsetDateTime: Estimated or actual date or date-time  the condition began, in the opinion of
            the clinician.

            the clinician.

        abatementDateTime: The date or estimated date that the condition resolved or went into remission.
            This is called "abatement" because of the many overloaded connotations
            associated with "remission" or "resolution" - Conditions are never really
            resolved, but they can abate.

        assertedDate: The date on which the existance of the Condition was first asserted or
            acknowledged.

        asserter: Individual who is making the condition statement.

        stage: Clinical stage or grade of a condition. May include formal severity
            assessments.

        evidence: Supporting Evidence / manifestations that are the basis on which this
            condition is suspected or confirmed.

        note: Additional information about the Condition. This is a general notes/comments
