        resourceType: This is a TestScript resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this test script when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this test
            script is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version of
            the test script. For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this test script when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the test script when
            it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
            arbitrary value managed by the test script author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the test script. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the test script.

        status: The status of this test script. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this test script is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the test script was published. The date
            must change if and when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the test script changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the test script.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the test script from a consumer's
            perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate test script instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the test script is intended to be used.

        purpose: Explaination of why this test script is needed and why it has been designed as
            it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the test script and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the test script.

        origin: An abstract server used in operations within this test script in the origin
            element.

        destination: An abstract server used in operations within this test script in the
            destination element.

        metadata: The required capability must exist and are assumed to function correctly on
            the FHIR server being tested.

        fixture: Fixture in the test script - by reference (uri). All fixtures are required for
            the test script to execute.

        profile: Reference to the profile to be used for validation.

        variable: Variable is set based either on element value in response body or on header
            field value in the response headers.

        rule: Assert rule to be used in one or more asserts within the test script.

        ruleset: Contains one or more rules.  Offers a way to group rules so assertions could
            reference the group of rules and have them all applied.

        setup: A series of required setup operations before tests are executed.

        test: A test in this script.

        teardown: A series of operations required to clean up after the all the tests are
            executed (successfully or otherwise).
