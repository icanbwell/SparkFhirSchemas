        path: The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path must be resolvable
            from the type of the required data. The path is allowed to contain qualifiers
            (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-
            cardinality sub-elements. Note that the index must be an integer constant. The
            path must resolve to an element of type code, Coding, or CodeableConcept.

        valueSetString: The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and value elements are
            exclusive. If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data
            items for which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path is
            a member of the specified valueset.

        valueSetReference: The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and value elements are
            exclusive. If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data
            items for which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path is
            a member of the specified valueset.

        valueCode: The codes for the code filter. Only one of valueSet, valueCode, valueCoding,
            or valueCodeableConcept may be specified. If values are given, the filter will
            return only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by
            the path has a value that is one of the specified codes.

        valueCoding: The Codings for the code filter. Only one of valueSet, valueCode,
            valueConding, or valueCodeableConcept may be specified. If values are given,
            the filter will return only those data items for which the code-valued
            attribute specified by the path has a value that is one of the specified
            Codings.

        valueCodeableConcept: The CodeableConcepts for the code filter. Only one of valueSet, valueCode,
            valueConding, or valueCodeableConcept may be specified. If values are given,
            the filter will return only those data items for which the code-valued
            attribute specified by the path has a value that is one of the specified
