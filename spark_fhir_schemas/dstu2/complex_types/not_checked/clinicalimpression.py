        resourceType: This is a ClinicalImpression resource

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to the clinical impression that remains
            consistent regardless of what server the impression is stored on.

        status: Identifies the workflow status of the assessment.

        code: Categorizes the type of clinical assessment performed.

        description: A summary of the context and/or cause of the assessment - why / where was it
            performed, and what patient events/status prompted it.

        subject: The patient or group of individuals assessed as part of this record.

        context: The encounter or episode of care this impression was created as part of.

        effectiveDateTime: The point in time or period over which the subject was assessed.

        effectivePeriod: The point in time or period over which the subject was assessed.

        date: Indicates when the documentation of the assessment was complete.

        assessor: The clinician performing the assessment.

        previous: A reference to the last assesment that was conducted bon this patient.
            Assessments are often/usually ongoing in nature; a care provider (practitioner
            or team) will make new assessments on an ongoing basis as new data arises or
            the patient's conditions changes.

        problem: This a list of the relevant problems/conditions for a patient.

        investigation: One or more sets of investigations (signs, symptions, etc.). The actual
            grouping of investigations vary greatly depending on the type and context of
            the assessment. These investigations may include data generated during the
            assessment process, or data previously generated and recorded that is
            pertinent to the outcomes.

        protocol: Reference to a specific published clinical protocol that was followed during
            this assessment, and/or that provides evidence in support of the diagnosis.

        summary: A text summary of the investigations and the diagnosis.

        finding: Specific findings or diagnoses that was considered likely or relevant to
            ongoing treatment.

        prognosisCodeableConcept: Estimate of likely outcome.

        prognosisReference: RiskAssessment expressing likely outcome.

        action: Action taken as part of assessment procedure.

        note: Commentary about the impression, typically recorded after the impression
            itself was made, though supplemental notes by the original author could also
            appear.
