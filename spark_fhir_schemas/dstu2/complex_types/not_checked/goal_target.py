        measure: The parameter whose value is being tracked, e.g. body weight, blood pressure,
            or hemoglobin A1c level.

            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the

            value at or above the low value.

        dueDate: Indicates either the date or the duration after start by which the goal should
            be met.

        dueDuration: Indicates either the date or the duration after start by which the goal should
