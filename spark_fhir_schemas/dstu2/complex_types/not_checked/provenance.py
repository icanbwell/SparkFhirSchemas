        resourceType: This is a Provenance resource

        target: The Reference(s) that were generated or updated by  the activity described in
            this resource. A provenance can point to more than one target if multiple
            resources were created/updated by the same activity.

        period: The period during which the activity occurred.

        recorded: The instant of time at which the activity was recorded.

        policy: Policy or plan the activity was defined by. Typically, a single activity may
            have multiple applicable policy documents, such as patient consent, guarantor
            funding, etc.

        location: Where the activity occurred, if relevant.

        reason: The reason that the activity was taking place.

        activity: An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or
            with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying,
            relocating, using, or generating entities.

        agent: An actor taking a role in an activity  for which it can be assigned some
            degree of responsibility for the activity taking place.

        entity: An entity used in this activity.

        signature: A digital signature on the target Reference(s). The signer should match a
            Provenance.agent. The purpose of the signature is indicated.
