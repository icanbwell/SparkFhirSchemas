        resourceType: This is a DataElement resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this data element when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this data
            element is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version of
            the data element. For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this data element when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the data element when
            it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
            arbitrary value managed by the data element author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        status: The status of this data element. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this data element is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the data element was published. The date
            must change if and when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the data element changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the data element.

        name: A natural language name identifying the data element. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the data element.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate data element instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the data element is intended to be used.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the data element and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the data element.

        stringency: Identifies how precise the data element is in its definition.

        mapping: Identifies a specification (other than a terminology) that the elements which
            make up the DataElement have some correspondence with.

        element: Defines the structure, type, allowed values and other constraining
            characteristics of the data element.
