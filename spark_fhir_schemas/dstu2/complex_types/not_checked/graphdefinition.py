        Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set.


        resourceType: This is a GraphDefinition resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this graph definition when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this graph
            definition is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version
            of the graph definition. For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the graph definition
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the graph definition author and is not expected
            to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
            a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the graph definition. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        status: The status of this graph definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this graph definition is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the graph definition was published. The
            date must change if and when the business version changes and it must change
            if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the graph definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the graph
            definition.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the graph definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate graph definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the graph definition is intended to be
            used.

        purpose: Explaination of why this graph definition is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        start: The type of FHIR resource at which instances of this graph start.

        profile: The profile that describes the use of the base resource.

        link: Links this graph makes rules about.
