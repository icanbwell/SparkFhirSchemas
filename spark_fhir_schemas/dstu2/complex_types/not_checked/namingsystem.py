        resourceType: This is a NamingSystem resource

        name: A natural language name identifying the naming system. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        status: The status of this naming system. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        kind: Indicates the purpose for the naming system - what kinds of things does it
            make unique?

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the naming system was published. The date
            must change if and when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the naming system changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the naming system.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        responsible: The name of the organization that is responsible for issuing identifiers or
            codes for this namespace and ensuring their non-collision.

        type: Categorizes a naming system for easier search by grouping related naming
            systems.

        description: A free text natural language description of the naming system from a
            consumer's perspective. Details about what the namespace identifies including
            scope, granularity, version labeling, etc.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate naming system instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the naming system is intended to be
            used.

        usage: Provides guidance on the use of the namespace, including the handling of
            formatting characters, use of upper vs. lower case, etc.

        uniqueId: Indicates how the system may be identified when referenced in electronic
            exchange.

        replacedBy: For naming systems that are retired, indicates the naming system that should
            be used in their place (if any).
