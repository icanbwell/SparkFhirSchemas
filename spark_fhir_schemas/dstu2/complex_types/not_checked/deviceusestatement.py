        identifier: An external identifier for this statement such as an IRI.

        status: A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of
            the device used that this statement is about.  Generally this will be active

        whenUsed: The time period over which the device was used.

        timingTiming: How often the device was used.

        timingPeriod: How often the device was used.

        timingDateTime: How often the device was used.

        recordedOn: The time at which the statement was made/recorded.

        source: Who reported the device was being used by the patient.

        device: The details of the device used.
