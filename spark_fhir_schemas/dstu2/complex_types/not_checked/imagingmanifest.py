        resourceType: This is a ImagingManifest resource

        identifier: Unique identifier of the DICOM Key Object Selection (KOS) that this resource
            represents.

        patient: A patient resource reference which is the patient subject of all DICOM SOP
            Instances in this ImagingManifest.

        authoringTime: Date and time when the selection of the referenced instances were made. It is
            (typically) different from the creation date of the selection resource, and
            from dates associated with the referenced instances (e.g. capture time of the
            referenced image).

        author: Author of ImagingManifest. It can be a human author or a device which made the
            decision of the SOP instances selected. For example, a radiologist selected a
            set of imaging SOP instances to attach in a diagnostic report, and a CAD
            application may author a selection to describe SOP instances it used to
            generate a detection conclusion.

        description: Free text narrative description of the ImagingManifest.
            The value may be derived from the DICOM Standard Part 16, CID-7010
            descriptions (e.g. Best in Set, Complete Study Content). Note that those
            values cover the wide range of uses of the DICOM Key Object Selection object,
            several of which are not supported by ImagingManifest. Specifically, there is
            no expected behavior associated with descriptions that suggest referenced
            images be removed or not used.

        study: Study identity and locating information of the DICOM SOP instances in the
            selection.
