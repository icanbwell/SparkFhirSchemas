            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.
        In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict

        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
            type: A type of resource exposed via the restful interface.
            profile: A specification of the profile that describes the solution's overall support
        for the resource, including any constraints on cardinality, bindings, lengths
        or other limitations. See further discussion in [Using
        Profiles]{profiling.html#profile-uses}.
            interaction: Identifies a restful operation supported by the solution.
            versioning: This field is set to no-version to specify that the system does not support
        (server) or use (client) versioning for this resource type. If this has some
        other value, the server must at least correctly track and populate the
        versionId meta-property on resources. If the value is 'versioned-update', then
        the server supports all the versioning features, including using e-tags for
        version integrity in the API.
            readHistory: A flag for whether the server is able to return past versions as part of the
        vRead operation.
            updateCreate: A flag to indicate that the server allows or needs to allow the client to
        create new identities on the server (e.g. that is, the client PUTs to a
        location where there is no existing resource). Allowing this operation means
        that the server allows the client to create new identities on the server.
            conditionalCreate: A flag that indicates that the server supports conditional create.
            conditionalUpdate: A flag that indicates that the server supports conditional update.
            conditionalDelete: A code that indicates how the server supports conditional delete.
            searchInclude: A list of _include values supported by the server.
            searchRevInclude: A list of _revinclude (reverse include) values supported by the server.
            searchParam: Search parameters for implementations to support and/or make use of - either
        references to ones defined in the specification, or additional ones defined
        for/by the implementation.
