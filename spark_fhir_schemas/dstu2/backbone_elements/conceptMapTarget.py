            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
        use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.
            modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element, and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification.

            codeSystem: An absolute URI that identifies the code system of the target code (if the
        target is a value set that cross code systems).
            code: Identity (code or path) or the element/item that the map refers to.
            equivalence: The equivalence between the source and target concepts (counting for the
        dependencies and products). The equivalence is read from target to source
        (e.g. the target is 'wider' than the source).
            comments: A description of status/issues in mapping that conveys additional information
        not represented in  the structured data.
            dependsOn: A set of additional dependencies for this mapping to hold. This mapping is
        only applicable if the specified element can be resolved, and it has the
        specified value.
            product: A set of additional outcomes from this mapping to other elements. To properly
        execute this mapping, the specified element must be mapped to some data
        element or source that is in context. The mapping may still be useful without
        a place for the additional data elements, but the equivalence cannot be relied
        on.
