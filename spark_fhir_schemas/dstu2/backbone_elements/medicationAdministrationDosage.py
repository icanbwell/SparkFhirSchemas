            extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
        manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

        there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
        the extension.

            route: A code specifying the route or physiological path of administration of a
        therapeutic agent into or onto the patient.  For example, topical,
        intravenous, etc.
            method: A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to be
        or was introduced into or on the body.  This attribute will most often NOT be
        populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  For example, Slow Push,
        Deep IV.
            quantity: The amount of the medication given at one administration event.   Use this
        value when the administration is essentially an instantaneous event such as a
        swallowing a tablet or giving an injection.
