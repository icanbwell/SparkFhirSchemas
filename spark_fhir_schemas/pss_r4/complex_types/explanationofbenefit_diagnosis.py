        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify diagnosis entries.

        diagnosisCodeableConcept: The nature of illness or problem in a coded form or as a reference to an
            external defined Condition.

        diagnosisReference: The nature of illness or problem in a coded form or as a reference to an
            external defined Condition.

        type: When the condition was observed or the relative ranking.

        onAdmission: Indication of whether the diagnosis was present on admission to a facility.

        packageCode: A package billing code or bundle code used to group products and services to a
            particular health condition (such as heart attack) which is based on a
            predetermined grouping code system.
