        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        code: A code that identifies the kind of trait being asserted.

        valueCodeableConcept: The value of the trait that holds (or does not hold - see 'exclude') for
            members of the group.

        valueBoolean: The value of the trait that holds (or does not hold - see 'exclude') for
            members of the group.

        valueQuantity: The value of the trait that holds (or does not hold - see 'exclude') for
            members of the group.

        valueRange: The value of the trait that holds (or does not hold - see 'exclude') for
            members of the group.

        valueReference: The value of the trait that holds (or does not hold - see 'exclude') for
            members of the group.

        exclude: If true, indicates the characteristic is one that is NOT held by members of
            the group.

        period: The period over which the characteristic is tested; e.g. the patient had an
            operation during the month of June.
