        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        code: This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a colonoscopy or
            an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event is inherent in the
            typeCode, such as a "History and Physical Report" in which the procedure being
            documented is necessarily a "History and Physical" act.

        period: The period of time covered by the documentation. There is no assertion that
            the documentation is a complete representation for this period, only that it
            documents events during this time.

        detail: The description and/or reference of the event(s) being documented. For
            example, this could be used to document such a colonoscopy or an appendectomy.
