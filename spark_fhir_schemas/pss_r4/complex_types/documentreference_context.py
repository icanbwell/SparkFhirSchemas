        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care that the document content is
            associated with.

        event: This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a colonoscopy or
            an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event is inherent in the
            type Code, such as a "History and Physical Report" in which the procedure
            being documented is necessarily a "History and Physical" act.

        period: The time period over which the service that is described by the document was
            provided.

        facilityType: The kind of facility where the patient was seen.

        practiceSetting: This property may convey specifics about the practice setting where the
            content was created, often reflecting the clinical specialty.

        sourcePatientInfo: The Patient Information as known when the document was published. May be a
            reference to a version specific, or contained.

        related: Related identifiers or resources associated with the DocumentReference.
