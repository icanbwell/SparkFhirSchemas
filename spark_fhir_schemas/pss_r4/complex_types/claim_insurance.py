            resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the

        businessArrangement: A business agreement number established between the provider and the insurer
            for special business processing purposes.

            quoted on subsequent claims containing services or products related to the
            prior authorization.

        claimResponse: The result of the adjudication of the line items for the Coverage specified in
