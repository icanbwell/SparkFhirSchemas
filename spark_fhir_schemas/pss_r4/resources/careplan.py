        resourceType: This is a CarePlan resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this care plan by the performer or other
            systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from
            server to server.

        instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other
            definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan.

        instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline,
            questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by
            this CarePlan.

        basedOn: A care plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this care plan.

        replaces: Completed or terminated care plan whose function is taken by this new care
            plan.

        partOf: A larger care plan of which this particular care plan is a component or step.

        status: Indicates whether the plan is currently being acted upon, represents future
            intentions or is now a historical record.

        intent: Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the care plan
            and where the care plan fits into the workflow chain.

        category: Identifies what "kind" of plan this is to support differentiation between
            multiple co-existing plans; e.g. "Home health", "psychiatric", "asthma",
            "disease management", "wellness plan", etc.

        title: Human-friendly name for the care plan.

        description: A description of the scope and nature of the plan.

        subject: Identifies the patient or group whose intended care is described by the plan.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this CarePlan was created or to which the creation
            of this record is tightly associated.

        period: Indicates when the plan did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.

        created: Represents when this particular CarePlan record was created in the system,
            which is often a system-generated date.

        author: When populated, the author is responsible for the care plan.  The care plan is
            attributed to the author.

        contributor: Identifies the individual(s) or organization who provided the contents of the
            care plan.

        careTeam: Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the
            care envisioned by this plan.

        addresses: Identifies the conditions/problems/concerns/diagnoses/etc. whose management
            and/or mitigation are handled by this plan.

        supportingInfo: Identifies portions of the patient's record that specifically influenced the
            formation of the plan.  These might include comorbidities, recent procedures,
            limitations, recent assessments, etc.

        goal: Describes the intended objective(s) of carrying out the care plan.

        activity: Identifies a planned action to occur as part of the plan.  For example, a
            medication to be used, lab tests to perform, self-monitoring, education, etc.

        note: General notes about the care plan not covered elsewhere.
