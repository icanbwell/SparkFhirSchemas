        resourceType: This is a ImmunizationEvaluation resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization evaluation record.

        status: Indicates the current status of the evaluation of the vaccination
            administration event.

        patient: The individual for whom the evaluation is being done.

        date: The date the evaluation of the vaccine administration event was performed.

        authority: Indicates the authority who published the protocol (e.g. ACIP).

        targetDisease: The vaccine preventable disease the dose is being evaluated against.

        immunizationEvent: The vaccine administration event being evaluated.

        doseStatus: Indicates if the dose is valid or not valid with respect to the published
            recommendations.

        doseStatusReason: Provides an explanation as to why the vaccine administration event is valid or
            not relative to the published recommendations.

        description: Additional information about the evaluation.

        series: One possible path to achieve presumed immunity against a disease - within the
            context of an authority.

        doseNumberPositiveInt: Nominal position in a series.

        doseNumberString: Nominal position in a series.

        seriesDosesPositiveInt: The recommended number of doses to achieve immunity.

        seriesDosesString: The recommended number of doses to achieve immunity.
