        resourceType: This is a Binary resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules

        securityContext: This element identifies another resource that can be used as a proxy of the
            security sensitivity to use when deciding and enforcing access control rules
            for the Binary resource. Given that the Binary resource contains very few

            relationships to individuals, the referenced resource stands in as a proxy
            equivalent for this purpose. This referenced resource may be related to the
            Binary (e.g. Media, DocumentReference), or may be some non-related Resource
            purely as a security proxy. E.g. to identify that the binary resource relates
            to a patient, and access should only be granted to applications that have
            access to the patient.

        data: The actual content, base64 encoded.
