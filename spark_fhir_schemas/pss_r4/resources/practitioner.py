        resourceType: This is a Practitioner resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: An identifier that applies to this person in this role.

        active: Whether this practitioner's record is in active use.

        name: The name(s) associated with the practitioner.

        telecom: A contact detail for the practitioner, e.g. a telephone number or an email
            address.

        address: Address(es) of the practitioner that are not role specific (typically home
            address).
            Work addresses are not typically entered in this property as they are usually
            role dependent.

        gender: Administrative Gender - the gender that the person is considered to have for
            administration and record keeping purposes.

        birthDate: The date of birth for the practitioner.

        photo: Image of the person.

        qualification: The official certifications, training, and licenses that authorize or
            otherwise pertain to the provision of care by the practitioner.  For example,
            a medical license issued by a medical board authorizing the practitioner to
            practice medicine within a certian locality.

        communication: A language the practitioner can use in patient communication.
