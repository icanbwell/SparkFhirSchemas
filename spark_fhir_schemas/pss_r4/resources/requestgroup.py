        resourceType: This is a RequestGroup resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Allows a service to provide a unique, business identifier for the request.

        instantiatesCanonical: A canonical URL referencing a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or
            other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this request.

        instantiatesUri: A URL referencing an externally defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
            definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this request.

        basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this
            request.

        replaces: Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new
            request.

        groupIdentifier: A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less
            simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the
            requisition, prescription or similar form.

        status: The current state of the request. For request groups, the status reflects the
            status of all the requests in the group.

        intent: Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the request
            and where the request fits into the workflow chain.

        priority: Indicates how quickly the request should be addressed with respect to other
            requests.

        code: A code that identifies what the overall request group is.

        subject: The subject for which the request group was created.

        encounter: Describes the context of the request group, if any.

        authoredOn: Indicates when the request group was created.

        author: Provides a reference to the author of the request group.

        reasonCode: Describes the reason for the request group in coded or textual form.

        reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this request group.

        note: Provides a mechanism to communicate additional information about the response.

        action: The actions, if any, produced by the evaluation of the artifact.
