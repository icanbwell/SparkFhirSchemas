        resourceType: This is a AuditEvent resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        type: Identifier for a family of the event.  For example, a menu item, program,
            rule, policy, function code, application name or URL. It identifies the
            performed function.

        subtype: Identifier for the category of event.

        action: Indicator for type of action performed during the event that generated the
            audit.

        period: The period during which the activity occurred.

        recorded: The time when the event was recorded.

        outcome: Indicates whether the event succeeded or failed.

        outcomeDesc: A free text description of the outcome of the event.

        purposeOfEvent: The purposeOfUse (reason) that was used during the event being recorded.

        agent: An actor taking an active role in the event or activity that is logged.

        source: The system that is reporting the event.

        entity: Specific instances of data or objects that have been accessed.
