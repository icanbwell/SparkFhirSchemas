        concepts, or classes in class models.


        resourceType: This is a ConceptMap resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this concept map when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this concept map is (or
            will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It
            SHALL remain the same when the concept map is stored on different servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this concept map when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the concept map when
            it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
            arbitrary value managed by the concept map author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the concept map. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the concept map.

        status: The status of this concept map. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this concept map is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the concept map was published. The date
            must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status
            code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of
            the concept map changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the concept map.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the concept map from a consumer's
            perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate concept map
            instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the concept map is intended to be used.

        purpose: Explanation of why this concept map is needed and why it has been designed as
            it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the concept map and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the concept map.

        sourceUri: Identifier for the source value set that contains the concepts that are being
            mapped and provides context for the mappings.

        sourceCanonical: Identifier for the source value set that contains the concepts that are being
            mapped and provides context for the mappings.

        targetUri: The target value set provides context for the mappings. Note that the mapping
            is made between concepts, not between value sets, but the value set provides
            important context about how the concept mapping choices are made.

        targetCanonical: The target value set provides context for the mappings. Note that the mapping
            is made between concepts, not between value sets, but the value set provides
            important context about how the concept mapping choices are made.

        group: A group of mappings that all have the same source and target system.
