        grouped into coherent subsets, corresponding to the structure of the grouping
        of the questionnaire being responded to.


        resourceType: This is a QuestionnaireResponse resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A business identifier assigned to a particular completed (or partially
            completed) questionnaire.

        basedOn: The order, proposal or plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this
            QuestionnaireResponse.  For example, a ServiceRequest seeking an intake
            assessment or a decision support recommendation to assess for post-partum
            depression.

        partOf: A procedure or observation that this questionnaire was performed as part of
            the execution of.  For example, the surgery a checklist was executed as part
            of.

        questionnaire: The Questionnaire that defines and organizes the questions for which answers
            are being provided.

        status: The position of the questionnaire response within its overall lifecycle.

        subject: The subject of the questionnaire response.  This could be a patient,
            organization, practitioner, device, etc.  This is who/what the answers apply
            to, but is not necessarily the source of information.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this questionnaire response was created or to which
            the creation of this record is tightly associated.

        authored: The date and/or time that this set of answers were last changed.

        author: Person who received the answers to the questions in the QuestionnaireResponse
            and recorded them in the system.

        source: The person who answered the questions about the subject.

        item: A group or question item from the original questionnaire for which answers are
            provided.
