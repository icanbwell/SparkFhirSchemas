        resourceType: This is a Goal resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this goal by the performer or other systems
            which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to
            server.

        lifecycleStatus: The state of the goal throughout its lifecycle.

        achievementStatus: Describes the progression, or lack thereof, towards the goal against the
            target.

        category: Indicates a category the goal falls within.

        priority: Identifies the mutually agreed level of importance associated with
            reaching/sustaining the goal.

        description: Human-readable and/or coded description of a specific desired objective of
            care, such as "control blood pressure" or "negotiate an obstacle course" or
            "dance with child at wedding".

        subject: Identifies the patient, group or organization for whom the goal is being
            established.

        startDate: The date or event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        startCodeableConcept: The date or event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        target: Indicates what should be done by when.

        statusDate: Identifies when the current status.  I.e. When initially created, when
            achieved, when cancelled, etc.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current status.

        expressedBy: Indicates whose goal this is - patient goal, practitioner goal, etc.

        addresses: The identified conditions and other health record elements that are intended
            to be addressed by the goal.

        note: Any comments related to the goal.

        outcomeCode: Identifies the change (or lack of change) at the point when the status of the
            goal is assessed.

        outcomeReference: Details of what's changed (or not changed).
