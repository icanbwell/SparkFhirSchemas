        resourceType: This is a Invoice resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifier of this Invoice, often used for reference in correspondence about
            this invoice or for tracking of payments.

        status: The current state of the Invoice.

        cancelledReason: In case of Invoice cancellation a reason must be given (entered in error,
            superseded by corrected invoice etc.).

        type: Type of Invoice depending on domain, realm an usage (e.g. internal/external,
            dental, preliminary).

        subject: The individual or set of individuals receiving the goods and services billed
            in this invoice.

        recipient: The individual or Organization responsible for balancing of this invoice.

        date: Date/time(s) of when this Invoice was posted.

        participant: Indicates who or what performed or participated in the charged service.

        issuer: The organizationissuing the Invoice.

        account: Account which is supposed to be balanced with this Invoice.

        lineItem: Each line item represents one charge for goods and services rendered. Details
            such as date, code and amount are found in the referenced ChargeItem resource.

        totalPriceComponent: The total amount for the Invoice may be calculated as the sum of the line
            items with surcharges/deductions that apply in certain conditions.  The
            priceComponent element can be used to offer transparency to the recipient of
            the Invoice of how the total price was calculated.

        totalNet: Invoice total , taxes excluded.

        totalGross: Invoice total, tax included.

        paymentTerms: Payment details such as banking details, period of payment, deductibles,
            methods of payment.

        note: Comments made about the invoice by the issuer, subject, or other participants.
