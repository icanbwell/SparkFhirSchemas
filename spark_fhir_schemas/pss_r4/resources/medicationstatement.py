    The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication

    from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is
    often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the
    medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported
    the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity,

    administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.

        medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication
        administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.


        resourceType: This is a MedicationStatement resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifiers associated with this Medication Statement that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate. They are business identifiers assigned
            to this resource by the performer or other systems and remain constant as the
            resource is updated and propagates from server to server.

        basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.

        status: A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of
            the medication used that this statement is about.  Generally, this will be
            active or completed.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the MedicationStatement.

        category: Indicates where the medication is expected to be consumed or administered.

        medicationCodeableConcept: Identifies the medication being administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        medicationReference: Identifies the medication being administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        subject: The person, animal or group who is/was taking the medication.

        context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this
            MedicationStatement.

        effectiveDateTime: The interval of time during which it is being asserted that the patient
            is/was/will be taking the medication (or was not taking, when the
            MedicationStatement.taken element is No).

        effectivePeriod: The interval of time during which it is being asserted that the patient
            is/was/will be taking the medication (or was not taking, when the
            MedicationStatement.taken element is No).

        dateAsserted: The date when the medication statement was asserted by the information source.

        informationSource: The person or organization that provided the information about the taking of
            this medication. Note: Use derivedFrom when a MedicationStatement is derived
            from other resources, e.g. Claim or MedicationRequest.

        derivedFrom: Allows linking the MedicationStatement to the underlying MedicationRequest, or
            to other information that supports or is used to derive the
            MedicationStatement.

        reasonCode: A reason for why the medication is being/was taken.

        reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication is being/was taken.

        note: Provides extra information about the medication statement that is not conveyed
            by the other attributes.

        dosage: Indicates how the medication is/was or should be taken by the patient.
