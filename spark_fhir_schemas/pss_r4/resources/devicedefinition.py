        The characteristics, operational status and capabilities of a medical-related
        component of a medical device.


        resourceType: This is a DeviceDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by the software,
            manufacturers, other organizations or owners. For example: handle ID.

        udiDeviceIdentifier: Unique device identifier (UDI) assigned to device label or package.  Note that
            the Device may include multiple udiCarriers as it either may include just the
            udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it
            could have been sold.

        manufacturerString: A name of the manufacturer.

        manufacturerReference: A name of the manufacturer.

        deviceName: A name given to the device to identify it.

        modelNumber: The model number for the device.

        type: What kind of device or device system this is.

        specialization: The capabilities supported on a  device, the standards to which the device
            conforms for a particular purpose, and used for the communication.

        version: The available versions of the device, e.g., software versions.

        safety: Safety characteristics of the device.

        shelfLifeStorage: Shelf Life and storage information.

        physicalCharacteristics: Dimensions, color etc.

        languageCode: Language code for the human-readable text strings produced by the device (all
            supported).

        capability: Device capabilities.

        property: The actual configuration settings of a device as it actually operates, e.g.,
            regulation status, time properties.

        owner: An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance
            of the device.

        contact: Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible
            for the device.

        url: A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.

        onlineInformation: Access to on-line information about the device.

        note: Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is
            not captured in an existing element.

        quantity: The quantity of the device present in the packaging (e.g. the number of
            devices present in a pack, or the number of devices in the same package of the
            medicinal product).

        parentDevice: The parent device it can be part of.

        material: A substance used to create the material(s) of which the device is made.
