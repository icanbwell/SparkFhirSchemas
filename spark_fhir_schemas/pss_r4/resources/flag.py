        resourceType: This is a Flag resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this flag by the performer or other systems
            which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to
            server.

        status: Supports basic workflow.

        category: Allows a flag to be divided into different categories like clinical,
            administrative etc. Intended to be used as a means of filtering which flags
            are displayed to particular user or in a given context.

        code: The coded value or textual component of the flag to display to the user.

        subject: The patient, location, group, organization, or practitioner etc. this is about
            record this flag is associated with.

        period: The period of time from the activation of the flag to inactivation of the
            flag. If the flag is active, the end of the period should be unspecified.

        encounter: This alert is only relevant during the encounter.

        author: The person, organization or device that created the flag.
