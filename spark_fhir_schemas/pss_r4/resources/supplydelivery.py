        Record of delivery of what is supplied.


        resourceType: This is a SupplyDelivery resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifier for the supply delivery event that is used to identify it across
            multiple disparate systems.

        basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.

        status: A code specifying the state of the dispense event.

        patient: A link to a resource representing the person whom the delivered item is for.

        type: Indicates the type of dispensing event that is performed. Examples include:
            Trial Fill, Completion of Trial, Partial Fill, Emergency Fill, Samples, etc.

        suppliedItem: The item that is being delivered or has been supplied.

        occurrenceDateTime: The date or time(s) the activity occurred.

        occurrencePeriod: The date or time(s) the activity occurred.

        occurrenceTiming: The date or time(s) the activity occurred.

        supplier: The individual responsible for dispensing the medication, supplier or device.

        destination: Identification of the facility/location where the Supply was shipped to, as
            part of the dispense event.

        receiver: Identifies the person who picked up the Supply.
