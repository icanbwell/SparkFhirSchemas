        resourceType: This is a Consent resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Unique identifier for this copy of the Consent Statement.

        status: Indicates the current state of this consent.

        scope: A selector of the type of consent being presented: ADR, Privacy, Treatment,
            Research.  This list is now extensible.

        category: A classification of the type of consents found in the statement. This element
            supports indexing and retrieval of consent statements.

        patient: The patient/healthcare consumer to whom this consent applies.

        dateTime: When this  Consent was issued / created / indexed.

        performer: Either the Grantor, which is the entity responsible for granting the rights
            listed in a Consent Directive or the Grantee, which is the entity responsible
            for complying with the Consent Directive, including any obligations or
            limitations on authorizations and enforcement of prohibitions.

        organization: The organization that manages the consent, and the framework within which it
            is executed.

        sourceAttachment: The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a
            scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to
            such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the
            original consent document.

        sourceReference: The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a
            scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to
            such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the
            original consent document.

        policy: The references to the policies that are included in this consent scope.
            Policies may be organizational, but are often defined jurisdictionally, or in
            law.

        policyRule: A reference to the specific base computable regulation or policy.

        verification: Whether a treatment instruction (e.g. artificial respiration yes or no) was
            verified with the patient, his/her family or another authorized person.

        provision: An exception to the base policy of this consent. An exception can be an
            addition or removal of access permissions.
