        resourceType: This is a OrganizationAffiliation resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers that are specific to this role.

        active: Whether this organization affiliation record is in active use.

        period: The period during which the participatingOrganization is affiliated with the
            primary organization.

        organization: Organization where the role is available (primary organization/has members).

        participatingOrganization: The Participating Organization provides/performs the role(s) defined by the
            code to the Primary Organization (e.g. providing services or is a member of).

        network: Health insurance provider network in which the participatingOrganization
            provides the role's services (if defined) at the indicated locations (if
            defined).

        code: Definition of the role the participatingOrganization plays in the association.

        specialty: Specific specialty of the participatingOrganization in the context of the
            role.

        location: The location(s) at which the role occurs.

        healthcareService: Healthcare services provided through the role.

        telecom: Contact details at the participatingOrganization relevant to this Affiliation.

        endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for this role.
