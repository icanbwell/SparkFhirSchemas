        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a GuidanceResponse resource

        requestId: The id of the request associated with this response. If an id was given as
            part of the request, it will be reproduced here to enable the requester to
            more easily identify the response in a multi-request scenario.

        identifier: Allows a service to provide a unique, business identifier for the response.

        module: A reference to the knowledge module that was invoked.

        status: The status of the response. If the evaluation is completed successfully, the
            status will indicate success. However, in order to complete the evaluation,
            the engine may require more information. In this case, the status will be
            data-required, and the response will contain a description of the additional
            required information. If the evaluation completed successfully, but the engine
            determines that a potentially more accurate response could be provided if more
            data was available, the status will be data-requested, and the response will
            contain a description of the additional requested information.

        subject: The patient for which the request was processed.

        context: Allows the context of the guidance response to be provided if available. In a
            service context, this would likely be unavailable.

        occurrenceDateTime: Indicates when the guidance response was processed.

        performer: Provides a reference to the device that performed the guidance.

        reasonCodeableConcept: Indicates the reason the request was initiated. This is typically provided as
            a parameter to the evaluation and echoed by the service, although for some use
            cases, such as subscription- or event-based scenarios, it may provide an
            indication of the cause for the response.

        reasonReference: Indicates the reason the request was initiated. This is typically provided as
            a parameter to the evaluation and echoed by the service, although for some use
            cases, such as subscription- or event-based scenarios, it may provide an
            indication of the cause for the response.

        note: Provides a mechanism to communicate additional information about the response.

        evaluationMessage: Messages resulting from the evaluation of the artifact or artifacts. As part
            of evaluating the request, the engine may produce informational or warning
            messages. These messages will be provided by this element.

        outputParameters: The output parameters of the evaluation, if any. Many modules will result in
            the return of specific resources such as procedure or communication requests
            that are returned as part of the operation result. However, modules may define
            specific outputs that would be returned as the result of the evaluation, and
            these would be returned in this element.

        result: The actions, if any, produced by the evaluation of the artifact.

        dataRequirement: If the evaluation could not be completed due to lack of information, or
            additional information would potentially result in a more accurate response,
            this element will a description of the data required in order to proceed with
            the evaluation. A subsequent request to the service should include this data.
