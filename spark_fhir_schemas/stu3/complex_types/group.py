        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Group resource

        identifier: A unique business identifier for this group.

        active: Indicates whether the record for the group is available for use or is merely
            being retained for historical purposes.

        type: Identifies the broad classification of the kind of resources the group
            includes.

        actual: If true, indicates that the resource refers to a specific group of real
            individuals.  If false, the group defines a set of intended individuals.

        code: Provides a specific type of resource the group includes; e.g. "cow",
            "syringe", etc.

        name: A label assigned to the group for human identification and communication.

        quantity: A count of the number of resource instances that are part of the group.

        characteristic: Identifies the traits shared by members of the group.

        member: Identifies the resource instances that are members of the group.
