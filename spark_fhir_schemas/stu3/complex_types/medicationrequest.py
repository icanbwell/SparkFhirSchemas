        resourceType: This is a MedicationRequest resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this medication request that are
            defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL
            reference to the resource itself is not appropriate. For example a re-
            imbursement system might issue its own id for each prescription that is
            created.  This is particularly important where FHIR only provides part of an
            entire workflow process where records must be tracked through an entire
            system.

        definition: Protocol or definition followed by this request.

        basedOn: A plan or request that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this medication
            request.

        groupIdentifier: A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less
            simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the
            requisition or prescription.

        status: A code specifying the current state of the order.  Generally this will be
            active or completed state.

        intent: Whether the request is a proposal, plan, or an original order.

        category: Indicates the type of medication order and where the medication is expected to
            be consumed or administered.

        priority: Indicates how quickly the Medication Request should be addressed with respect
            to other requests.

        medicationCodeableConcept: Identifies the medication being requested. This is a link to a resource that
            represents the medication which may be the details of the medication or simply
            an attribute carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list
            of medications.

        medicationReference: Identifies the medication being requested. This is a link to a resource that
            represents the medication which may be the details of the medication or simply
            an attribute carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list
            of medications.

        subject: A link to a resource representing the person or set of individuals to whom the
            medication will be given.

        context: A link to an encounter, or episode of care, that identifies the particular
            occurrence or set occurrences of contact between patient and health care
            provider.

        supportingInformation: Include additional information (for example, patient height and weight) that
            supports the ordering of the medication.

        authoredOn: The date (and perhaps time) when the prescription was initially written or
            authored on.

        requester: The individual, organization or device that initiated the request and has
            responsibility for its activation.

        recorder: The person who entered the order on behalf of another individual for example
            in the case of a verbal or a telephone order.

        reasonCode: The reason or the indication for ordering the medication.

        reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication was ordered.

        note: Extra information about the prescription that could not be conveyed by the
            other attributes.

        dosageInstruction: Indicates how the medication is to be used by the patient.

        dispenseRequest: Indicates the specific details for the dispense or medication supply part of a
            medication request (also known as a Medication Prescription or Medication
            Order).  Note that this information is not always sent with the order.  There
            may be in some settings (e.g. hospitals) institutional or system support for
            completing the dispense details in the pharmacy department.

        substitution: Indicates whether or not substitution can or should be part of the dispense.
            In some cases substitution must happen, in other cases substitution must not
            happen. This block explains the prescriber's intent. If nothing is specified
            substitution may be done.

        priorPrescription: A link to a resource representing an earlier order related order or
            prescription.

        detectedIssue: Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more
            active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction,
            duplicate therapy, dosage alert etc.

        eventHistory: Links to Provenance records for past versions of this resource or fulfilling
            request or event resources that identify key state transitions or updates that
            are likely to be relevant to a user looking at the current version of the
            resource.
