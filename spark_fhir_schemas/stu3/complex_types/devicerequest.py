        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a DeviceRequest resource

        identifier: Identifiers assigned to this order by the orderer or by the receiver.

        definition: Protocol or definition followed by this request. For example: The proposed act
            must be performed if the indicated conditions occur, e.g.., shortness of
            breath, SpO2 less than x%.

        basedOn: Plan/proposal/order fulfilled by this request.

        priorRequest: The request takes the place of the referenced completed or terminated
            request(s).

        groupIdentifier: Composite request this is part of.

        status: The status of the request.

        intent: Whether the request is a proposal, plan, an original order or a reflex order.

        priority: Indicates how quickly the {{title}} should be addressed with respect to other
            requests.

        codeReference: The details of the device to be used.

        codeCodeableConcept: The details of the device to be used.

        subject: The patient who will use the device.

        context: An encounter that provides additional context in which this request is made.

        occurrenceDateTime: The timing schedule for the use of the device. The Schedule data type allows
            many different expressions, for example. "Every 8 hours"; "Three times a day";
            "1/2 an hour before breakfast for 10 days from 23-Dec 2011:"; "15 Oct 2013, 17
            Oct 2013 and 1 Nov 2013".

        occurrencePeriod: The timing schedule for the use of the device. The Schedule data type allows
            many different expressions, for example. "Every 8 hours"; "Three times a day";
            "1/2 an hour before breakfast for 10 days from 23-Dec 2011:"; "15 Oct 2013, 17
            Oct 2013 and 1 Nov 2013".

        occurrenceTiming: The timing schedule for the use of the device. The Schedule data type allows
            many different expressions, for example. "Every 8 hours"; "Three times a day";
            "1/2 an hour before breakfast for 10 days from 23-Dec 2011:"; "15 Oct 2013, 17
            Oct 2013 and 1 Nov 2013".

        authoredOn: When the request transitioned to being actionable.

        requester: The individual who initiated the request and has responsibility for its
            activation.

        performerType: Desired type of performer for doing the diagnostic testing.

        performer: The desired perfomer for doing the diagnostic testing.

        reasonCode: Reason or justification for the use of this device.

        reasonReference: Reason or justification for the use of this device.

        supportingInfo: Additional clinical information about the patient that may influence the
            request fulfilment.  For example, this may includes body where on the
            subject's the device will be used ( i.e. the target site).

        note: Details about this request that were not represented at all or sufficiently in
            one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a
            comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.

        relevantHistory: Key events in the history of the request.
