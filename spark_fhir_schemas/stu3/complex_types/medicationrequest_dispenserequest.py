        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        validityPeriod: This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the
            Prescription).

        numberOfRepeatsAllowed: An integer indicating the number of times, in addition to the original
            dispense, (aka refills or repeats) that the patient can receive the prescribed
            medication. Usage Notes: This integer does not include the original order
            dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus "3
            repeats", then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient
            can receive a total of 120 tablets.

        quantity: The amount that is to be dispensed for one fill.

        expectedSupplyDuration: Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be
            used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last.

        performer: Indicates the intended dispensing Organization specified by the prescriber.
