        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Device resource

        identifier: Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by manufacturers other
            organizations or owners.

        udi: [Unique device identifier (UDI)](device.html#5.11.3.2.2) assigned to device
            label or package.

        status: Status of the Device availability.

        type: Code or identifier to identify a kind of device.

        lotNumber: Lot number assigned by the manufacturer.

        manufacturer: A name of the manufacturer.

        manufactureDate: The date and time when the device was manufactured.

        expirationDate: The date and time beyond which this device is no longer valid or should not be
            used (if applicable).

        model: The "model" is an identifier assigned by the manufacturer to identify the
            product by its type. This number is shared by the all devices sold as the same
            type.

        version: The version of the device, if the device has multiple releases under the same
            model, or if the device is software or carries firmware.

        patient: Patient information, If the device is affixed to a person.

        owner: An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance
            of the device.

        contact: Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible
            for the device.

        location: The place where the device can be found.

        url: A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.

        note: Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is
            not captured in an existing element.

        safety: Provides additional safety characteristics about a medical device.  For
            example devices containing latex.
