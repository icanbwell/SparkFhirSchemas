        resourceType: This is a Goal resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this care plan that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written /
            printed documentation).

        status: Indicates whether the goal has been reached and is still considered relevant.

        category: Indicates a category the goal falls within.

        priority: Identifies the mutually agreed level of importance associated with
            reaching/sustaining the goal.

        description: Human-readable and/or coded description of a specific desired objective of
            care, such as "control blood pressure" or "negotiate an obstacle course" or
            "dance with child at wedding".

        subject: Identifies the patient, group or organization for whom the goal is being
            established.

        startDate: The date or event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        startCodeableConcept: The date or event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        target: Indicates what should be done by when.

        statusDate: Identifies when the current status.  I.e. When initially created, when
            achieved, when cancelled, etc.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current status.

        expressedBy: Indicates whose goal this is - patient goal, practitioner goal, etc.

        addresses: The identified conditions and other health record elements that are intended
            to be addressed by the goal.

        note: Any comments related to the goal.

        outcomeCode: Identifies the change (or lack of change) at the point when the status of the
            goal is assessed.

        outcomeReference: Details of what's changed (or not changed).
