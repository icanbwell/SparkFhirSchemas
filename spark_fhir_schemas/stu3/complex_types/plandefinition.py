        resourceType: This is a PlanDefinition resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this plan definition when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this plan
            definition is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version
            of the plan definition. For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this plan definition when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the plan definition
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the plan definition author and is not expected
            to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
            a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent
            with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format
            Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning
            knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note
            that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.

        name: A natural language name identifying the plan definition. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the plan definition.

        type: The type of asset the plan definition represents, e.g. an order set, protocol,
            or event-condition-action rule.

        status: The status of this plan definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this plan definition is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the plan definition was published. The
            date must change if and when the business version changes and it must change
            if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the plan definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the plan definition.

        description: A free text natural language description of the plan definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        purpose: Explaination of why this plan definition is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        usage: A detailed description of how the asset is used from a clinical perspective.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval, but doesn't change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the plan definition content was or is planned to be in
            active use.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate plan definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the plan definition is intended to be
            used.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the plan definition. Topics
            provide a high-level categorization of the definition that can be useful for
            filtering and searching.

        contributor: A contributor to the content of the asset, including authors, editors,
            reviewers, and endorsers.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the plan definition and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the plan definition.

        relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        library: A reference to a Library resource containing any formal logic used by the plan
            definition.

        goal: Goals that describe what the activities within the plan are intended to
            achieve. For example, weight loss, restoring an activity of daily living,
            obtaining herd immunity via immunization, meeting a process improvement
            objective, etc.

        action: An action to be taken as part of the plan.
