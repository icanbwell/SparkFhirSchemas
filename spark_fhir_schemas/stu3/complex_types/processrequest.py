        This resource provides the target, request and response, and action details
        for an action to be performed by the target on or about existing resources.


        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a ProcessRequest resource

        identifier: The ProcessRequest business identifier.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        action: The type of processing action being requested, for example Reversal,
            Readjudication, StatusRequest,PendedRequest.

        target: The organization which is the target of the request.

        created: The date when this resource was created.

        provider: The practitioner who is responsible for the action specified in this request.

        organization: The organization which is responsible for the action speccified in this
            request.

        request: Reference of resource which is the target or subject of this action.

        response: Reference of a prior response to resource which is the target or subject of
            this action.

        nullify: If true remove all history excluding audit.

        reference: A reference to supply which authenticates the process.

        item: List of top level items to be re-adjudicated, if none specified then the
            entire submission is re-adjudicated.

        include: Names of resource types to include.

        exclude: Names of resource types to exclude.

        period: A period of time during which the fulfilling resources would have been
            created.
