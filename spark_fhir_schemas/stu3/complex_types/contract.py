        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.

            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource

            power of attorny, Privacy or Security policy , trust framework agreement, etc.

        subType: More specific type or specialization of an overarching or more general
            contract such as auto insurance, home owner  insurance, prenupial agreement,
            Advanced-Directive, or privacy consent.

        action: Action stipulated by this Contract.

        actionReason: Reason for action stipulated by this Contract.
