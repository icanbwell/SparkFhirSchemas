        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a CarePlan resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this care plan that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written /
            printed documentation).

        definition: Identifies the protocol, questionnaire, guideline or other specification the
            care plan should be conducted in accordance with.

        basedOn: A care plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this care plan.

        replaces: Completed or terminated care plan whose function is taken by this new care
            plan.

        partOf: A larger care plan of which this particular care plan is a component or step.

        status: Indicates whether the plan is currently being acted upon, represents future
            intentions or is now a historical record.

        intent: Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the care plan
            and where the care plan fits into the workflow chain.

        category: Identifies what "kind" of plan this is to support differentiation between
            multiple co-existing plans; e.g. "Home health", "psychiatric", "asthma",
            "disease management", "wellness plan", etc.

        title: Human-friendly name for the CarePlan.

        description: A description of the scope and nature of the plan.

        subject: Identifies the patient or group whose intended care is described by the plan.

        context: Identifies the original context in which this particular CarePlan was created.

        period: Indicates when the plan did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.

        author: Identifies the individual(s) or ogranization who is responsible for the
            content of the care plan.

        careTeam: Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the
            care envisioned by this plan.

        addresses: Identifies the conditions/problems/concerns/diagnoses/etc. whose management
            and/or mitigation are handled by this plan.

        supportingInfo: Identifies portions of the patient's record that specifically influenced the
            formation of the plan.  These might include co-morbidities, recent procedures,
            limitations, recent assessments, etc.

        goal: Describes the intended objective(s) of carrying out the care plan.

        activity: Identifies a planned action to occur as part of the plan.  For example, a
            medication to be used, lab tests to perform, self-monitoring, education, etc.

        note: General notes about the care plan not covered elsewhere.
