        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Immunization resource

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.

        status: Indicates the current status of the vaccination event.

        notGiven: Indicates if the vaccination was or was not given.

        vaccineCode: Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.

        patient: The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.

        encounter: The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care
            provider the immunization was performed as part of.

        date: Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.

        primarySource: An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the
            person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the
            data was originally recorded.

        reportOrigin: The source of the data when the report of the immunization event is not based
            on information from the person who administered the vaccine.

        location: The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.

        manufacturer: Name of vaccine manufacturer.

        lotNumber: Lot number of the  vaccine product.

        expirationDate: Date vaccine batch expires.

        site: Body site where vaccine was administered.

        route: The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.

        doseQuantity: The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.

        practitioner: Indicates who or what performed the event.

        note: Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other
            attributes.

        explanation: Reasons why a vaccine was or was not administered.

        reaction: Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an
            immunization.

        vaccinationProtocol: Contains information about the protocol(s) under which the vaccine was
            administered.
