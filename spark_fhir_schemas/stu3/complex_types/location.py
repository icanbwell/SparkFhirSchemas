        resourceType: This is a Location resource

        identifier: Unique code or number identifying the location to its users.

        status: The status property covers the general availability of the resource, not the
            current value which may be covered by the operationStatus, or by a
            schedule/slots if they are configured for the location.

        operationalStatus: The Operational status covers operation values most relevant to beds (but can
            also apply to rooms/units/chair/etc such as an isolation unit/dialisys chair).
            This typically covers concepts such as contamination, housekeeping and other
            activities like maintenance.

        name: Name of the location as used by humans. Does not need to be unique.

        alias: A list of alternate names that the location is known as, or was known as in
            the past.

        description: Description of the Location, which helps in finding or referencing the place.

        mode: Indicates whether a resource instance represents a specific location or a
            class of locations.

        type: Indicates the type of function performed at the location.

        telecom: The contact details of communication devices available at the location. This
            can include phone numbers, fax numbers, mobile numbers, email addresses and
            web sites.

        address: Physical location.

        physicalType: Physical form of the location, e.g. building, room, vehicle, road.

        position: The absolute geographic location of the Location, expressed using the WGS84
            datum (This is the same co-ordinate system used in KML).

        managingOrganization: The organization responsible for the provisioning and upkeep of the location.

        partOf: Another Location which this Location is physically part of.

        endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the location.
