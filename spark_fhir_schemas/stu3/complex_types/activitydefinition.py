        resourceType: This is a ActivityDefinition resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this activity definition when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this
            activity definition is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the
            major version of the activity definition. For more information see [Technical
            and Business Versions](resource.html#versions).

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this activity definition when it
            is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
            design or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the activity
            definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
            instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the activity definition author
            and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
            timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also
            no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To
            provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification,
            use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on
            versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service
            specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active
            assets.

        name: A natural language name identifying the activity definition. This name should
            be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
            such as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the activity definition.

        status: The status of this activity definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this activity definition is authored for
            testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to
            be used for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the activity definition was published.
            The date must change if and when the business version changes and it must
            change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
            substantive content of the activity definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the activity
            definition.

        description: A free text natural language description of the activity definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        purpose: Explaination of why this activity definition is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        usage: A detailed description of how the asset is used from a clinical perspective.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval, but doesn't change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the activity definition content was or is planned to
            be in active use.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate activity definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the activity definition is intended to
            be used.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the activity. Topics provide a
            high-level categorization of the activity that can be useful for filtering and
            searching.

        contributor: A contributor to the content of the asset, including authors, editors,
            reviewers, and endorsers.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the activity definition and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the activity definition.

        relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        library: A reference to a Library resource containing any formal logic used by the
            asset.

        kind: A description of the kind of resource the activity definition is representing.
            For example, a MedicationRequest, a ProcedureRequest, or a
            CommunicationRequest. Typically, but not always, this is a Request resource.

        code: Detailed description of the type of activity; e.g. What lab test, what
            procedure, what kind of encounter.

        timingTiming: The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.

        timingDateTime: The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.

        timingPeriod: The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.

        timingRange: The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.

        location: Identifies the facility where the activity will occur; e.g. home, hospital,
            specific clinic, etc.

        participant: Indicates who should participate in performing the action described.

        productReference: Identifies the food, drug or other product being consumed or supplied in the
            activity.

        productCodeableConcept: Identifies the food, drug or other product being consumed or supplied in the
            activity.

        quantity: Identifies the quantity expected to be consumed at once (per dose, per meal,
            etc.).

        dosage: Provides detailed dosage instructions in the same way that they are described
            for MedicationRequest resources.

        bodySite: Indicates the sites on the subject's body where the procedure should be
            performed (I.e. the target sites).

        transform: A reference to a StructureMap resource that defines a transform that can be
            executed to produce the intent resource using the ActivityDefinition instance
            as the input.

        dynamicValue: Dynamic values that will be evaluated to produce values for elements of the
            resulting resource. For example, if the dosage of a medication must be
            computed based on the patient's weight, a dynamic value would be used to
            specify an expression that calculated the weight, and the path on the intent
            resource that would contain the result.
