        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        mode: Defines which action to take if there is no match in the group. One of 3
            actions is possible: use the unmapped code (this is useful when doing a
            mapping between versions, and only a few codes have changed), use a fixed code
            (a default code), or alternatively, a reference to a different concept map can
            be provided (by canonical URL).

        code: The fixed code to use when the mode = 'fixed'  - all unmapped codes are mapped
            to a single fixed code.

        display: The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors when
            editing the concept map.

        url: The canonical URL of the map to use if this map contains no mapping.
