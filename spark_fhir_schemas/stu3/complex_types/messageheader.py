        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a MessageHeader resource

        event: Code that identifies the event this message represents and connects it with
            its definition. Events defined as part of the FHIR specification have the
            system value "http://hl7.org/fhir/message-events".

        destination: The destination application which the message is intended for.

        receiver: Allows data conveyed by a message to be addressed to a particular person or
            department when routing to a specific application isn't sufficient.

        sender: Identifies the sending system to allow the use of a trust relationship.

        timestamp: The time that the message was sent.

        enterer: The person or device that performed the data entry leading to this message.
            When there is more than one candidate, pick the most proximal to the message.
            Can provide other enterers in extensions.

        author: The logical author of the message - the person or device that decided the
            described event should happen. When there is more than one candidate, pick the
            most proximal to the MessageHeader. Can provide other authors in extensions.

        source: The source application from which this message originated.

        responsible: The person or organization that accepts overall responsibility for the
            contents of the message. The implication is that the message event happened
            under the policies of the responsible party.

        reason: Coded indication of the cause for the event - indicates  a reason for the
            occurrence of the event that is a focus of this message.

        response: Information about the message that this message is a response to.  Only
            present if this message is a response.

        focus: The actual data of the message - a reference to the root/focus class of the
            event.
