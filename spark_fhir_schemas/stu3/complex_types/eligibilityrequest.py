            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the

            version changes to the resource.

            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a EligibilityRequest resource

        identifier: The Response business identifier.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        priority: Immediate (STAT), best effort (NORMAL), deferred (DEFER).

        patient: Patient Resource.

        servicedDate: The date or dates when the enclosed suite of services were performed or
            completed.

        servicedPeriod: The date or dates when the enclosed suite of services were performed or
