        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        label: The label would be used for tracking/logging purposes by test engines.

        description: The description would be used by test engines for tracking and reporting
            purposes.

        direction: The direction to use for the assertion.

        compareToSourceId: Id of the source fixture used as the contents to be evaluated by either the
            "source/expression" or "sourceId/path" definition.

        compareToSourceExpression: The fluentpath expression to evaluate against the source fixture. When
            compareToSourceId is defined, either compareToSourceExpression or
            compareToSourcePath must be defined, but not both.

        compareToSourcePath: XPath or JSONPath expression to evaluate against the source fixture. When
            compareToSourceId is defined, either compareToSourceExpression or
            compareToSourcePath must be defined, but not both.

        contentType: The content-type or mime-type to use for RESTful operation in the 'Content-
            Type' header.

        expression: The fluentpath expression to be evaluated against the request or response
            message contents - HTTP headers and payload.

        headerField: The HTTP header field name e.g. 'Location'.

        minimumId: The ID of a fixture.  Asserts that the response contains at a minimum the
            fixture specified by minimumId.

        navigationLinks: Whether or not the test execution performs validation on the bundle navigation
            links.

        operator: The operator type defines the conditional behavior of the assert. If not
            defined, the default is equals.

        path: The XPath or JSONPath expression to be evaluated against the fixture
            representing the response received from server.

        requestMethod: The request method or HTTP operation code to compare against that used by the
            client system under test.

        requestURL: The value to use in a comparison against the request URL path string.

        resource: The type of the resource.  See http://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html.

        response: okay | created | noContent | notModified | bad | forbidden | notFound |
            methodNotAllowed | conflict | gone | preconditionFailed | unprocessable.

        responseCode: The value of the HTTP response code to be tested.

        rule: The TestScript.rule this assert will evaluate.

        ruleset: The TestScript.ruleset this assert will evaluate.

        sourceId: Fixture to evaluate the XPath/JSONPath expression or the headerField  against.

        validateProfileId: The ID of the Profile to validate against.

        value: The value to compare to.

        warningOnly: Whether or not the test execution will produce a warning only on error for
            this assert.
