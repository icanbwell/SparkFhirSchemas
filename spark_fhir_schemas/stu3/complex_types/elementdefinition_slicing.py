        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        discriminator: Designates which child elements are used to discriminate between the slices
            when processing an instance. If one or more discriminators are provided, the
            value of the child elements in the instance data SHALL completely distinguish
            which slice the element in the resource matches based on the allowed values
            for those elements in each of the slices.

        description: A human-readable text description of how the slicing works. If there is no
            discriminator, this is required to be present to provide whatever information
            is possible about how the slices can be differentiated.

        ordered: If the matching elements have to occur in the same order as defined in the
            profile.

        rules: Whether additional slices are allowed or not. When the slices are ordered,
            profile authors can also say that additional slices are only allowed at the
            end.
