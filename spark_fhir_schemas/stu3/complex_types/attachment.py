        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        contentType: Identifies the type of the data in the attachment and allows a method to be
            chosen to interpret or render the data. Includes mime type parameters such as
            charset where appropriate.

        language: The human language of the content. The value can be any valid value according
            to BCP 47.

        data: The actual data of the attachment - a sequence of bytes. In XML, represented
            using base64.

        url: An alternative location where the data can be accessed.

        size: The number of bytes of data that make up this attachment (before base64
            encoding, if that is done).

        hash: The calculated hash of the data using SHA-1. Represented using base64.

        title: A label or set of text to display in place of the data.

        creation: The date that the attachment was first created.
