        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Observation resource

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this observation.

        basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.

        status: The status of the result value.

        category: A code that classifies the general type of observation being made.

        code: Describes what was observed. Sometimes this is called the observation "name".

        subject: The patient, or group of patients, location, or device whose characteristics
            (direct or indirect) are described by the observation and into whose record
            the observation is placed.  Comments: Indirect characteristics may be those of
            a specimen, fetus, donor,  other observer (for example a relative or EMT), or
            any observation made about the subject.

        context: The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction)
            during which this observation is made.

        effectiveDateTime: The time or time-period the observed value is asserted as being true. For
            biological subjects - e.g. human patients - this is usually called the
            "physiologically relevant time". This is usually either the time of the
            procedure or of specimen collection, but very often the source of the
            date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.

        effectivePeriod: The time or time-period the observed value is asserted as being true. For
            biological subjects - e.g. human patients - this is usually called the
            "physiologically relevant time". This is usually either the time of the
            procedure or of specimen collection, but very often the source of the
            date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.

        issued: The date and time this observation was made available to providers, typically
            after the results have been reviewed and verified.

        performer: Who was responsible for asserting the observed value as "true".

        valueQuantity: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueCodeableConcept: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueString: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueBoolean: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueRange: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueRatio: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueSampledData: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueAttachment: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueTime: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valueDateTime: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        valuePeriod: The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the
            information has a simple value.

        dataAbsentReason: Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x]
            is missing.

        interpretation: The assessment made based on the result of the observation.  Intended as a
            simple compact code often placed adjacent to the result value in reports and
            flow sheets to signal the meaning/normalcy status of the result. Otherwise
            known as abnormal flag.

        comment: May include statements about significant, unexpected or unreliable values, or
            information about the source of the value where this may be relevant to the
            interpretation of the result.

        bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e.
            the target site).

        method: Indicates the mechanism used to perform the observation.

        specimen: The specimen that was used when this observation was made.

        device: The device used to generate the observation data.

        referenceRange: Guidance on how to interpret the value by comparison to a normal or
            recommended range.

        related: A  reference to another resource (usually another Observation) whose
            relationship is defined by the relationship type code.

        component: Some observations have multiple component observations.  These component
            observations are expressed as separate code value pairs that share the same
            attributes.  Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations
            for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for
            genetics observations.
