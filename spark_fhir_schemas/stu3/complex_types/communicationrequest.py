        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a CommunicationRequest resource

        identifier: A unique ID of this request for reference purposes. It must be provided if
            user wants it returned as part of any output, otherwise it will be
            autogenerated, if needed, by CDS system. Does not need to be the actual ID of
            the source system.

        basedOn: A plan or proposal that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this request.

        replaces: Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new
            request.

        groupIdentifier: A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less
            simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the
            requisition, prescription or similar form.

        status: The status of the proposal or order.

        category: The type of message to be sent such as alert, notification, reminder,
            instruction, etc.

        priority: Characterizes how quickly the proposed act must be initiated. Includes
            concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.

        medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).

        subject: The patient or group that is the focus of this communication request.

        recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, device,
            group, or care team) which is the intended target of the communication.

        topic: The resources which were related to producing this communication request.

        context: The encounter or episode of care within which the communication request was
            created.

        payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) to be communicated to the recipient.

        occurrenceDateTime: The time when this communication is to occur.

        occurrencePeriod: The time when this communication is to occur.

        authoredOn: For draft requests, indicates the date of initial creation.  For requests with
            other statuses, indicates the date of activation.

        sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
            which is to be the source of the communication.

        requester: The individual who initiated the request and has responsibility for its
            activation.

        reasonCode: Describes why the request is being made in coded or textual form.

        reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this request.

        note: Comments made about the request by the requester, sender, recipient, subject
            or other participants.
