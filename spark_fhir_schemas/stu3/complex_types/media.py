        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Media resource

        identifier: Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the
            image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids)
            and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers.

        basedOn: A procedure that is fulfilled in whole or in part by the creation of this
            media.

        type: Whether the media is a photo (still image), an audio recording, or a video
            recording.

        subtype: Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of
            device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media
            resource, then this is the modality.

        view: The name of the imaging view e.g. Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP).

        subject: Who/What this Media is a record of.

        context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this media.

        occurrenceDateTime: The date and time(s) at which the media was collected.

        occurrencePeriod: The date and time(s) at which the media was collected.

        operator: The person who administered the collection of the image.

        reasonCode: Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.

        bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the media was collected (i.e.
            the target site).

        device: The device used to collect the media.

        height: Height of the image in pixels (photo/video).

        width: Width of the image in pixels (photo/video).

        frames: The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an
            imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or
            an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in
            order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget
            is required.

        duration: The duration of the recording in seconds - for audio and video.

        content: The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media
            source file.

        note: Comments made about the media by the performer, subject or other participants.
