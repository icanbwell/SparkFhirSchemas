        A search parameter that defines a named search item that can be used to
        search/filter on a resource.


        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a SearchParameter resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this search parameter when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this search
            parameter is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version
            of the search parameter. For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the search parameter
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the search parameter author and is not expected
            to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
            a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the search parameter. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        status: The status of this search parameter. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this search parameter is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the search parameter was published. The
            date must change if and when the business version changes and it must change
            if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the search parameter changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the search
            parameter.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate search parameter instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the search parameter is intended to be
            used.

        purpose: Explaination of why this search parameter is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        code: The code used in the URL or the parameter name in a parameters resource for
            this search parameter.

        base: The base resource type(s) that this search parameter can be used against.

        type: The type of value a search parameter refers to, and how the content is
            interpreted.

        derivedFrom: Where this search parameter is originally defined. If a derivedFrom is
            provided, then the details in the search parameter must be consistent with the
            definition from which it is defined. I.e. the parameter should have the same
            meaning, and (usually) the functionality should be a proper subset of the
            underlying search parameter.

        description: A free text natural language description of the search parameter from a
            consumer's perspective. and how it used.

        expression: A FHIRPath expression that returns a set of elements for the search parameter.

        xpath: An XPath expression that returns a set of elements for the search parameter.

        xpathUsage: How the search parameter relates to the set of elements returned by evaluating
            the xpath query.

        target: Types of resource (if a resource is referenced).

        comparator: Comparators supported for the search parameter.

        modifier: A modifier supported for the search parameter.

        chain: Contains the names of any search parameters which may be chained to the
            containing search parameter. Chained parameters may be added to search
            parameters of type reference, and specify that resources will only be returned
            if they contain a reference to a resource which matches the chained parameter
            value. Values for this field should be drawn from SearchParameter.code for a
            parameter on the target resource type.

        component: Used to define the parts of a composite search parameter.
