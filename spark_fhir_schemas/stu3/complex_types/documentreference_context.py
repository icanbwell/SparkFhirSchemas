        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

        encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care that the document content is
            associated with.

        event: This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a colonoscopy or
            an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event is inherent in the

        period: The time period over which the service that is described by the document was
            provided.

        facilityType: The kind of facility where the patient was seen.

        practiceSetting: This property may convey specifics about the practice setting where the
            content was created, often reflecting the clinical specialty.

        sourcePatientInfo: The Patient Information as known when the document was published. May be a
            reference to a version specific, or contained.

        related: Related identifiers or resources associated with the DocumentReference.
