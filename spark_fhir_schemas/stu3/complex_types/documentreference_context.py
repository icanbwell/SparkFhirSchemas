        encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care that the document content is
            associated with.

        event: This list of codes represents the main clinical acts, such as a colonoscopy or
            an appendectomy, being documented. In some cases, the event is inherent in the
            typeCode, such as a "History and Physical Report" in which the procedure being

        period: The time period over which the service that is described by the document was

        facilityType: The kind of facility where the patient was seen.

        practiceSetting: This property may convey specifics about the practice setting where the
