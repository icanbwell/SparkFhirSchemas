        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        uid: Formal identifier for this series.

        number: The numeric identifier of this series in the study.

        modality: The modality of this series sequence.

        description: A description of the series.

        numberOfInstances: Number of SOP Instances in the Study. The value given may be larger than the
            number of instance elements this resource contains due to resource
            availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present if
            any instance elements are present.

        availability: Availability of series (online, offline or nearline).

        endpoint: The network service providing access (e.g., query, view, or retrieval) for
            this series. See implementation notes for information about using DICOM
            endpoints. A series-level endpoint, if present, has precedence over a study-
            level endpoint with the same Endpoint.type.

        bodySite: The anatomic structures examined. See DICOM Part 16 Annex L (http://dicom.nema
            .org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_L.html) for DICOM to
            SNOMED-CT mappings. The bodySite may indicate the laterality of body part
            imaged; if so, it shall be consistent with any content of
            ImagingStudy.series.laterality.

        laterality: The laterality of the (possibly paired) anatomic structures examined. E.g.,
            the left knee, both lungs, or unpaired abdomen. If present, shall be
            consistent with any laterality information indicated in
            ImagingStudy.series.bodySite.

        started: The date and time the series was started.

        performer: The physician or operator (often the radiology technician)  who performed the
            series. The performer is recorded at the series level, since each series in a
            study may be performed by a different practitioner, at different times, and
            using different devices. A series may be performed by multiple practitioners.

        instance: A single SOP instance within the series, e.g. an image, or presentation state.
