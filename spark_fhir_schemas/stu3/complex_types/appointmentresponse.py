        resourceType: This is a AppointmentResponse resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this appointment response concern
            that are defined by business processes and/ or used to refer to it when a
            direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate.

        appointment: Appointment that this response is replying to.

        start: Date/Time that the appointment is to take place, or requested new start time.

        end: This may be either the same as the appointment request to confirm the details
            of the appointment, or alternately a new time to request a re-negotiation of
            the end time.

        participantType: Role of participant in the appointment.

        actor: A Person, Location/HealthcareService or Device that is participating in the
            appointment.

        participantStatus: Participation status of the participant. When the status is declined or
            tentative if the start/end times are different to the appointment, then these
            times should be interpreted as a requested time change. When the status is
            accepted, the times can either be the time of the appointment (as a
            confirmation of the time) or can be empty.

        comment: Additional comments about the appointment.
