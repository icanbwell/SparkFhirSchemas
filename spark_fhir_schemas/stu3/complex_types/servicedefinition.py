        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a ServiceDefinition resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this service definition when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a
            URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this service
            definition is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version
            of the service definition. For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this service definition when it
            is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
            design or an instance. This is used for CMS or NQF identifiers for a measure
            artifact. Note that at least one identifier is required for non-experimental
            active artifacts.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the service definition
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the service definition author and is not
            expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
            yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation
            that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the service definition. This name should
            be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
            such as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the service definition.

        status: The status of this service definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this service definition is authored for
            testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to
            be used for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the service definition was published. The
            date must change if and when the business version changes and it must change
            if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the service definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the service
            definition.

        description: A free text natural language description of the service definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        purpose: Explaination of why this service definition is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        usage: A detailed description of how the module is used from a clinical perspective.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval, but doesn't change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the service definition content was or is planned to be
            in active use.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate service definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the service definition is intended to be
            used.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the module. Topics provide a high-level
            categorization of the module that can be useful for filtering and searching.

        contributor: A contributor to the content of the module, including authors, editors,
            reviewers, and endorsers.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the service definition and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the service definition.

        relatedArtifact: Related resources such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        trigger: The trigger element defines when the rule should be invoked. This information
            is used by consumers of the rule to determine how to integrate the rule into a
            specific workflow.

        dataRequirement: Data requirements are a machine processable description of the data required
            by the module in order to perform a successful evaluation.

        operationDefinition: A reference to the operation that is used to invoke this service.
