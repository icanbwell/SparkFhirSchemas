        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Consent resource

        identifier: Unique identifier for this copy of the Consent Statement.

        status: Indicates the current state of this consent.

        category: A classification of the type of consents found in the statement. This element
            supports indexing and retrieval of consent statements.

        patient: The patient/healthcare consumer to whom this consent applies.

        period: Relevant time or time-period when this Consent is applicable.

        dateTime: When this  Consent was issued / created / indexed.

        consentingParty: Either the Grantor, which is the entity responsible for granting the rights
            listed in a Consent Directive or the Grantee, which is the entity responsible
            for complying with the Consent Directive, including any obligations or
            limitations on authorizations and enforcement of prohibitions.

        actor: Who or what is controlled by this consent. Use group to identify a set of
            actors by some property they share (e.g. 'admitting officers').

        action: Actions controlled by this consent.

        organization: The organization that manages the consent, and the framework within which it
            is executed.

        sourceAttachment: The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a
            scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to
            such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the
            original consent document.

        sourceIdentifier: The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a
            scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to
            such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the
            original consent document.

        sourceReference: The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a
            scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to
            such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the
            original consent document.

        policy: The references to the policies that are included in this consent scope.
            Policies may be organizational, but are often defined jurisdictionally, or in
            law.

        policyRule: A referece to the specific computable policy.

        securityLabel: A set of security labels that define which resources are controlled by this
            consent. If more than one label is specified, all resources must have all the
            specified labels.

        purpose: The context of the activities a user is taking - why the user is accessing the
            data - that are controlled by this consent.

        dataPeriod: Clinical or Operational Relevant period of time that bounds the data
            controlled by this consent.

        data: The resources controlled by this consent, if specific resources are
            referenced.

        except: An exception to the base policy of this consent. An exception can be an
            addition or removal of access permissions.
