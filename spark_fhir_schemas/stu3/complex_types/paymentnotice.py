        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a PaymentNotice resource

        identifier: The notice business identifier.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        request: Reference of resource for which payment is being made.

        response: Reference of response to resource for which payment is being made.

        statusDate: The date when the above payment action occurrred.

        created: The date when this resource was created.

        target: The Insurer who is target  of the request.

        provider: The practitioner who is responsible for the services rendered to the patient.

        organization: The organization which is responsible for the services rendered to the
            patient.

        paymentStatus: The payment status, typically paid: payment sent, cleared: payment received.
