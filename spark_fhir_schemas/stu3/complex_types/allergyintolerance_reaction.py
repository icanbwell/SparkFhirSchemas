        substance: Identification of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product)
            considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event. Note: the
            substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance
            identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For
            instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a
            composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be
            clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the
            'reaction.substance'.

        manifestation: Clinical symptoms and/or signs that are observed or associated with the
            adverse reaction event.

        description: Text description about the reaction as a whole, including details of the
            manifestation if required.

        onset: Record of the date and/or time of the onset of the Reaction.

        severity: Clinical assessment of the severity of the reaction event as a whole,
            potentially considering multiple different manifestations.

        exposureRoute: Identification of the route by which the subject was exposed to the substance.
