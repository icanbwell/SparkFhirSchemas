        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Schedule resource

        identifier: External Ids for this item.

        active: Whether this schedule record is in active use, or should not be used (such as
            was entered in error).

        serviceCategory: A broad categorisation of the service that is to be performed during this
            appointment.

        serviceType: The specific service that is to be performed during this appointment.

        specialty: The specialty of a practitioner that would be required to perform the service
            requested in this appointment.

        actor: The resource this Schedule resource is providing availability information for.
            These are expected to usually be one of HealthcareService, Location,
            Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Device, Patient or RelatedPerson.

        planningHorizon: The period of time that the slots that are attached to this Schedule resource
            cover (even if none exist). These  cover the amount of time that an
            organization's planning horizon; the interval for which they are currently
            accepting appointments. This does not define a "template" for planning outside
            these dates.

        comment: Comments on the availability to describe any extended information. Such as
            custom constraints on the slots that may be associated.
