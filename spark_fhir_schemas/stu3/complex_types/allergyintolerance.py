        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a AllergyIntolerance resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this allergy/intolerance concern that
            are defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL
            reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or
            in written / printed documentation).

        clinicalStatus: The clinical status of the allergy or intolerance.

        verificationStatus: Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk,
            of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical product).

        type: Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction
            risk.

        category: Category of the identified substance.

        criticality: Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to
            the identified substance.

        code: Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a
            negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or
            pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse
            reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g.,
            "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class
            (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement
            (e.g.,  "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").

        patient: The patient who has the allergy or intolerance.

        onsetDateTime: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetAge: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetPeriod: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetRange: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetString: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        assertedDate: The date on which the existance of the AllergyIntolerance was first asserted
            or acknowledged.

        recorder: Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.

        asserter: The source of the information about the allergy that is recorded.

        lastOccurrence: Represents the date and/or time of the last known occurrence of a reaction
            event.

        note: Additional narrative about the propensity for the Adverse Reaction, not
            captured in other fields.

        reaction: Details about each adverse reaction event linked to exposure to the identified
            substance.
