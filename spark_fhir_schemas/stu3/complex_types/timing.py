        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            the extension.

        event: Identifies specific times when the event occurs.

        repeat: A set of rules that describe when the event is scheduled.

        code: A code for the timing schedule. Some codes such as BID are ubiquitous, but
            many institutions define their own additional codes. If a code is provided,
            the code is understood to be a complete statement of whatever is specified in

            interpret the Timing, with the exception that .repeat.bounds still applies
