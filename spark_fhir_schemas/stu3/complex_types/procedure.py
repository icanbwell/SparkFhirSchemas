        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Procedure resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this procedure that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written /
            printed documentation).

        definition: A protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that was adhered to in
            whole or in part by this procedure.

        basedOn: A reference to a resource that contains details of the request for this
            procedure.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular procedure is a component or step.

        status: A code specifying the state of the procedure. Generally this will be in-
            progress or completed state.

        notDone: Set this to true if the record is saying that the procedure was NOT performed.

        notDoneReason: A code indicating why the procedure was not performed.

        category: A code that classifies the procedure for searching, sorting and display
            purposes (e.g. "Surgical Procedure").

        code: The specific procedure that is performed. Use text if the exact nature of the
            procedure cannot be coded (e.g. "Laparoscopic Appendectomy").

        subject: The person, animal or group on which the procedure was performed.

        context: The encounter during which the procedure was performed.

        performedDateTime: The date(time)/period over which the procedure was performed. Allows a period
            to support complex procedures that span more than one date, and also allows
            for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        performedPeriod: The date(time)/period over which the procedure was performed. Allows a period
            to support complex procedures that span more than one date, and also allows
            for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        performer: Limited to 'real' people rather than equipment.

        location: The location where the procedure actually happened.  E.g. a newborn at home, a
            tracheostomy at a restaurant.

        reasonCode: The coded reason why the procedure was performed. This may be coded entity of
            some type, or may simply be present as text.

        reasonReference: The condition that is the reason why the procedure was performed.

        bodySite: Detailed and structured anatomical location information. Multiple locations
            are allowed - e.g. multiple punch biopsies of a lesion.

        outcome: The outcome of the procedure - did it resolve reasons for the procedure being
            performed?

        report: This could be a histology result, pathology report, surgical report, etc..

        complication: Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate
            post-performance period. These are generally tracked separately from the
            notes, which will typically describe the procedure itself rather than any
            'post procedure' issues.

        complicationDetail: Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate
            post-performance period.

        followUp: If the procedure required specific follow up - e.g. removal of sutures. The
            followup may be represented as a simple note, or could potentially be more
            complex in which case the CarePlan resource can be used.

        note: Any other notes about the procedure.  E.g. the operative notes.

        focalDevice: A device that is implanted, removed or otherwise manipulated (calibration,
            battery replacement, fitting a prosthesis, attaching a wound-vac, etc.) as a
            focal portion of the Procedure.

        usedReference: Identifies medications, devices and any other substance used as part of the
            procedure.

        usedCode: Identifies coded items that were used as part of the procedure.
