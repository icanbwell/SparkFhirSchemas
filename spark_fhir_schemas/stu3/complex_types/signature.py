        type: An indication of the reason that the entity signed this document. This may be
            explicitly included as part of the signature information and can be used when
            determining accountability for various actions concerning the document.

        when: When the digital signature was signed.

        whoUri: A reference to an application-usable description of the identity that signed
            (e.g. the signature used their private key).

        whoReference: A reference to an application-usable description of the identity that signed
            (e.g. the signature used their private key).

        onBehalfOfUri: A reference to an application-usable description of the identity that is
            represented by the signature.

        onBehalfOfReference: A reference to an application-usable description of the identity that is
            represented by the signature.

        contentType: A mime type that indicates the technical format of the signature. Important
            mime types are application/signature+xml for X ML DigSig, application/jwt for
            JWT, and image/* for a graphical image of a signature, etc.

        blob: The base64 encoding of the Signature content. When signature is not recorded
            electronically this element would be empty.
