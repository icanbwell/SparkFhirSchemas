        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            the extension.

        system: An absolute URI which is the code system in which the code for this item in
            the expansion is defined.

        abstract: If true, this entry is included in the expansion for navigational purposes,
            and the user cannot select the code directly as a proper value.

        inactive: If the concept is inactive in the code system that defines it. Inactive codes
            are those that are no longer to be used, but are maintained by the code system
            for understanding legacy data.

        version: The version of this code system that defined this code and/or display. This
            should only be used with code systems that do not enforce concept permanence.

        code: The code for this item in the expansion hierarchy. If this code is missing the
            entry in the hierarchy is a place holder (abstract) and does not represent a
            valid code in the value set.

        display: The recommended display for this item in the expansion.

        designation: Additional representations for this item - other languages, aliases,
            specialized purposes, used for particular purposes, etc. These are relevant
            when the conditions of the expansion do not fix to a single correct
