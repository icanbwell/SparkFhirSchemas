        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Communication resource

        identifier: Identifiers associated with this Communication that are defined by business
            processes and/ or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to the
            resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or in written /
            printed documentation).

        definition: A protocol, guideline, or other definition that was adhered to in whole or in
            part by this communication event.

        basedOn: An order, proposal or plan fulfilled in whole or in part by this
            Communication.

        partOf: Part of this action.

        status: The status of the transmission.

        notDone: If true, indicates that the described communication event did not actually
            occur.

        notDoneReason: Describes why the communication event did not occur in coded and/or textual
            form.

        category: The type of message conveyed such as alert, notification, reminder,
            instruction, etc.

        medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).

        subject: The patient or group that was the focus of this communication.

        recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
            which was the target of the communication. If receipts need to be tracked by
            individual, a separate resource instance will need to be created for each
            recipient. Â Multiple recipient communications are intended where either a
            receipt(s) is not tracked (e.g. a mass mail-out) or is captured in aggregate
            (all emails confirmed received by a particular time).

        topic: The resources which were responsible for or related to producing this
            communication.

        context: The encounter within which the communication was sent.

        sent: The time when this communication was sent.

        received: The time when this communication arrived at the destination.

        sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
            which was the source of the communication.

        reasonCode: The reason or justification for the communication.

        reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this communication.

        payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) that was communicated to the recipient.

        note: Additional notes or commentary about the communication by the sender, receiver
            or other interested parties.
