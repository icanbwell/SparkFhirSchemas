            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a HealthcareService resource

        identifier: External identifiers for this item.

        active: Whether this healthcareservice record is in active use.

        providedBy: The organization that provides this healthcare service.

        category: Identifies the broad category of service being performed or delivered.

        type: The specific type of service that may be delivered or performed.

        photo: If there is a photo/symbol associated with this HealthcareService, it may be
            included here to facilitate quick identification of the service in a list.

        telecom: List of contacts related to this specific healthcare service.

        coverageArea: The location(s) that this service is available to (not where the service is
            provided).

        serviceProvisionCode: The code(s) that detail the conditions under which the healthcare service is
            available/offered.

        eligibility: Does this service have specific eligibility requirements that need to be met

            provided reason.

        availabilityExceptions: A description of site availability exceptions, e.g. public holiday
            availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to normal site
            availability as details in the available Times and not available Times.
