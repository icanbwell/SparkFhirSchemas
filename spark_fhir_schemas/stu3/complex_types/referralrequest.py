        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a ReferralRequest resource

        identifier: Business identifier that uniquely identifies the referral/care transfer
            request instance.

        definition: A protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in
            whole or in part by this request.

        basedOn: Indicates any plans, proposals or orders that this request is intended to
            satisfy - in whole or in part.

        replaces: Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new
            request.

        groupIdentifier: The business identifier of the logical "grouping" request/order that this
            referral is a part of.

        status: The status of the authorization/intention reflected by the referral request
            record.

        intent: Distinguishes the "level" of authorization/demand implicit in this request.

        type: An indication of the type of referral (or where applicable the type of
            transfer of care) request.

        priority: An indication of the urgency of referral (or where applicable the type of
            transfer of care) request.

        serviceRequested: The service(s) that is/are requested to be provided to the patient.  For
            example: cardiac pacemaker insertion.

        subject: The patient who is the subject of a referral or transfer of care request.

        context: The encounter at which the request for referral or transfer of care is
            initiated.

        occurrenceDateTime: The period of time within which the services identified in the
            referral/transfer of care is specified or required to occur.

        occurrencePeriod: The period of time within which the services identified in the
            referral/transfer of care is specified or required to occur.

        authoredOn: Date/DateTime of creation for draft requests and date of activation for active
            requests.

        requester: The individual who initiated the request and has responsibility for its
            activation.

        specialty: Indication of the clinical domain or discipline to which the referral or
            transfer of care request is sent.  For example: Cardiology Gastroenterology
            Diabetology.

        recipient: The healthcare provider(s) or provider organization(s) who/which is to receive
            the referral/transfer of care request.

        reasonCode: Description of clinical condition indicating why referral/transfer of care is
            requested.  For example:  Pathological Anomalies, Disabled (physical or
            mental),  Behavioral Management.

        reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this request.

        description: The reason element gives a short description of why the referral is being
            made, the description expands on this to support a more complete clinical
            summary.

        supportingInfo: Any additional (administrative, financial or clinical) information required to
            support request for referral or transfer of care.  For example: Presenting
            problems/chief complaints Medical History Family History Alerts
            Allergy/Intolerance and Adverse Reactions Medications Observations/Assessments
            (may include cognitive and fundtional assessments) Diagnostic Reports Care
            Plan.

        note: Comments made about the referral request by any of the participants.

        relevantHistory: Links to Provenance records for past versions of this resource or fulfilling
            request or event resources that identify key state transitions or updates that
            are likely to be relevant to a user looking at the current version of the
            resource.
