        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        condition: Reason the encounter takes place, as specified using information from another
            resource. For admissions, this is the admission diagnosis. The indication will
            typically be a Condition (with other resources referenced in the
            evidence.detail), or a Procedure.

        role: Role that this diagnosis has within the encounter (e.g. admission, billing,
            discharge …).

        rank: Ranking of the diagnosis (for each role type).
