        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a MedicationDispense resource

        identifier: Identifier assigned by the dispensing facility - this is an identifier
            assigned outside FHIR.

        partOf: The procedure that the dispense is done because of.

        status: A code specifying the state of the set of dispense events.

        category: Indicates type of medication dispense and where the medication is expected to
            be consumed or administered.

        medicationCodeableConcept: Identifies the medication being administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        medicationReference: Identifies the medication being administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        subject: A link to a resource representing the person or the group to whom the
            medication will be given.

        context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this event.

        supportingInformation: Additional information that supports the medication being dispensed.

        performer: Indicates who or what performed the event.  It should be assumed that the
            performer is the dispenser of the medication.

        authorizingPrescription: Indicates the medication order that is being dispensed against.

        type: Indicates the type of dispensing event that is performed. For example, Trial
            Fill, Completion of Trial, Partial Fill, Emergency Fill, Samples, etc.

        quantity: The amount of medication that has been dispensed. Includes unit of measure.

        daysSupply: The amount of medication expressed as a timing amount.

        whenPrepared: The time when the dispensed product was packaged and reviewed.

        whenHandedOver: The time the dispensed product was provided to the patient or their
            representative.

        destination: Identification of the facility/location where the medication was shipped to,
            as part of the dispense event.

        receiver: Identifies the person who picked up the medication.  This will usually be a
            patient or their caregiver, but some cases exist where it can be a healthcare
            professional.

        note: Extra information about the dispense that could not be conveyed in the other
            attributes.

        dosageInstruction: Indicates how the medication is to be used by the patient.

        substitution: Indicates whether or not substitution was made as part of the dispense.  In
            some cases substitution will be expected but does not happen, in other cases
            substitution is not expected but does happen.  This block explains what
            substitution did or did not happen and why.  If nothing is specified,
            substitution was not done.

        detectedIssue: Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more
            active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction,
            duplicate therapy, dosage alert etc.

        notDone: True if the dispense was not performed for some reason.

        notDoneReasonCodeableConcept: Indicates the reason why a dispense was not performed.

        notDoneReasonReference: Indicates the reason why a dispense was not performed.

        eventHistory: A summary of the events of interest that have occurred, such as when the
            dispense was verified.
