        A value set specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems.


        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a ValueSet resource

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this value set when it is referenced
            in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a URL, SHOULD
            be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this value set is (or
            will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version of the value set.
            For more information see [Technical and Business
            Versions](resource.html#versions).

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this value set when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the value set when it
            is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
            arbitrary value managed by the value set author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the value set. This name should be usable
            as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as
            code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the value set.

        status: The status of this value set. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.

        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this value set is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the value set was published. The date
            must change if and when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the value set changes. (e.g. the 'content logical definition').

        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published the value set.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the value set from a consumer's
            perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            for appropriate value set instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the value set is intended to be used.

        immutable: If this is set to 'true', then no new versions of the content logical
            definition can be created.  Note: Other metadata might still change.

        purpose: Explaination of why this value set is needed and why it has been designed as
            it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the value set and/or its contents. Copyright
            statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and publishing of the
            value set.

        extensible: Whether this is intended to be used with an extensible binding or not.

        compose: A set of criteria that define the content logical definition of the value set
            by including or excluding codes from outside this value set. This I also known
            as the "Content Logical Definition" (CLD).

        expansion: A value set can also be "expanded", where the value set is turned into a
            simple collection of enumerated codes. This element holds the expansion, if it
            has been performed.
