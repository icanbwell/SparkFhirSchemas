        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        deviceIdentifier: The device identifier (DI) is a mandatory, fixed portion of a UDI that
            identifies the labeler and the specific version or model of a device.

        name: Name of device as used in labeling or catalog.

        jurisdiction: The identity of the authoritative source for UDI generation within a
            jurisdiction.  All UDIs are globally unique within a single namespace. with
            the appropriate repository uri as the system.  For example,  UDIs of devices
            managed in the U.S. by the FDA, the value is
            http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/fda-udi.

        carrierHRF: The full UDI carrier as the human readable form (HRF) representation of the
            barcode string as printed on the packaging of the device.

        carrierAIDC: The full UDI carrier of the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC)
            technology representation of the barcode string as printed on the packaging of
            the device - E.g a barcode or RFID.   Because of limitations on character sets
            in XML and the need to round-trip JSON data through XML, AIDC Formats *SHALL*
            be base64 encoded.

        issuer: Organization that is charged with issuing UDIs for devices.  For example, the
            US FDA issuers include :
            1) GS1:
            http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/gs1-di,
