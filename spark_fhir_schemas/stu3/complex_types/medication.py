        This resource is primarily used for the identification and definition of a
        medication. It covers the ingredients and the packaging for a medication.


        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Medication resource

        code: A code (or set of codes) that specify this medication, or a textual
            description if no code is available. Usage note: This could be a standard
            medication code such as a code from RxNorm, SNOMED CT, IDMP etc. It could also
            be a national or local formulary code, optionally with translations to other
            code systems.

        status: A code to indicate if the medication is in active use.

        isBrand: Set to true if the item is attributable to a specific manufacturer.

        isOverTheCounter: Set to true if the medication can be obtained without an order from a
            prescriber.

        manufacturer: Describes the details of the manufacturer of the medication product.  This is
            not intended to represent the distributor of a medication product.

        form: Describes the form of the item.  Powder; tablets; capsule.

        ingredient: Identifies a particular constituent of interest in the product.

        package: Information that only applies to packages (not products).

        image: Photo(s) or graphic representation(s) of the medication.
