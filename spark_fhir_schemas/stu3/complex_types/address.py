        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        use: The purpose of this address.

        type: Distinguishes between physical addresses (those you can visit) and mailing
            addresses (e.g. PO Boxes and care-of addresses). Most addresses are both.

        text: A full text representation of the address.

        line: This component contains the house number, apartment number, street name,
            street direction,  P.O. Box number, delivery hints, and similar address
            information.

        city: The name of the city, town, village or other community or delivery center.

        district: The name of the administrative area (county).

        state: Sub-unit of a country with limited sovereignty in a federally organized
            country. A code may be used if codes are in common use (i.e. US 2 letter state
            codes).

        postalCode: A postal code designating a region defined by the postal service.

        country: Country - a nation as commonly understood or generally accepted.

        period: Time period when address was/is in use.
