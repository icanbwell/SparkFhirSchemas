        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a DeviceUseStatement resource

        identifier: An external identifier for this statement such as an IRI.

        status: A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of
            the device used that this statement is about.  Generally this will be active
            or completed.

        subject: The patient who used the device.

        whenUsed: The time period over which the device was used.

        timingTiming: How often the device was used.

        timingPeriod: How often the device was used.

        timingDateTime: How often the device was used.

        recordedOn: The time at which the statement was made/recorded.

        source: Who reported the device was being used by the patient.

        device: The details of the device used.

        indication: Reason or justification for the use of the device.

        bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the device was used ( i.e. the
            target site).

        note: Details about the device statement that were not represented at all or
            sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include
            for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the
            statement.
