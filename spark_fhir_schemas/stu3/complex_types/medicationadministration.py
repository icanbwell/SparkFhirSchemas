        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a MedicationAdministration resource

        identifier: External identifier - FHIR will generate its own internal identifiers
            (probably URLs) which do not need to be explicitly managed by the resource.
            The identifier here is one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for
            example an automated medication pump would provide a record each time it
            operated; an administration while the patient was off the ward might be made
            with a different system and entered after the event.  Particularly important
            if these records have to be updated.

        definition: A protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that was adhered to in
            whole or in part by this event.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.

        status: Will generally be set to show that the administration has been completed.  For
            some long running administrations such as infusions it is possible for an
            administration to be started but not completed or it may be paused while some
            other process is under way.

        category: Indicates the type of medication administration and where the medication is
            expected to be consumed or administered.

        medicationCodeableConcept: Identifies the medication that was administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        medicationReference: Identifies the medication that was administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        subject: The person or animal or group receiving the medication.

        context: The visit, admission or other contact between patient and health care provider
            the medication administration was performed as part of.

        supportingInformation: Additional information (for example, patient height and weight) that supports
            the administration of the medication.

        effectiveDateTime: A specific date/time or interval of time during which the administration took
            place (or did not take place, when the 'notGiven' attribute is true). For many
            administrations, such as swallowing a tablet the use of dateTime is more
            appropriate.

        effectivePeriod: A specific date/time or interval of time during which the administration took
            place (or did not take place, when the 'notGiven' attribute is true). For many
            administrations, such as swallowing a tablet the use of dateTime is more
            appropriate.

        performer: The individual who was responsible for giving the medication to the patient.

        notGiven: Set this to true if the record is saying that the medication was NOT
            administered.

        reasonNotGiven: A code indicating why the administration was not performed.

        reasonCode: A code indicating why the medication was given.

        reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication was administered.

        prescription: The original request, instruction or authority to perform the administration.

        device: The device used in administering the medication to the patient.  For example,
            a particular infusion pump.

        note: Extra information about the medication administration that is not conveyed by
            the other attributes.

        dosage: Describes the medication dosage information details e.g. dose, rate, site,
            route, etc.

        eventHistory: A summary of the events of interest that have occurred, such as when the
            administration was verified.
