        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Composition resource

        identifier: Logical identifier for the composition, assigned when created. This identifier
            stays constant as the composition is changed over time.

        status: The workflow/clinical status of this composition. The status is a marker for
            the clinical standing of the document.

        type: Specifies the particular kind of composition (e.g. History and Physical,
            Discharge Summary, Progress Note). This usually equates to the purpose of
            making the composition.

        class: A categorization for the type of the composition - helps for indexing and
            searching. This may be implied by or derived from the code specified in the
            Composition Type.

        subject: Who or what the composition is about. The composition can be about a person,
            (patient or healthcare practitioner), a device (e.g. a machine) or even a
            group of subjects (such as a document about a herd of livestock, or a set of
            patients that share a common exposure).

        encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care this documentation is
            associated with.

        date: The composition editing time, when the composition was last logically changed
            by the author.

        author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in the composition, not
            necessarily who typed it in.

        title: Official human-readable label for the composition.

        confidentiality: The code specifying the level of confidentiality of the Composition.

        attester: A participant who has attested to the accuracy of the composition/document.

        custodian: Identifies the organization or group who is responsible for ongoing
            maintenance of and access to the composition/document information.

        relatesTo: Relationships that this composition has with other compositions or documents
            that already exist.

        event: The clinical service, such as a colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being
            documented.

        section: The root of the sections that make up the composition.
