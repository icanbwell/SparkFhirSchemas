        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Coverage resource

        identifier: The main (and possibly only) identifier for the coverage - often referred to
            as a Member Id, Certificate number, Personal Health Number or Case ID. May be
            constructed as the concatination of the Coverage.SubscriberID and the
            Coverage.dependant.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        type: The type of coverage: social program, medical plan, accident coverage (workers
            compensation, auto), group health or payment by an individual or organization.

        policyHolder: The party who 'owns' the insurance policy,  may be an individual, corporation
            or the subscriber's employer.

        subscriber: The party who has signed-up for or 'owns' the contractual relationship to the
            policy or to whom the benefit of the policy for services rendered to them or
            their family is due.

        subscriberId: The insurer assigned ID for the Subscriber.

        beneficiary: The party who benefits from the insurance coverage., the patient when services
            are provided.

        relationship: The relationship of beneficiary (patient) to the subscriber.

        period: Time period during which the coverage is in force. A missing start date
            indicates the start date isn't known, a missing end date means the coverage is
            continuing to be in force.

        payor: The program or plan underwriter or payor including both insurance and non-
            insurance agreements, such as patient-pay agreements. May provide multiple
            identifiers such as insurance company identifier or business identifier (BIN
            number).

        grouping: A suite of underwrite specific classifiers, for example may be used to
            identify a class of coverage or employer group, Policy, Plan.

        dependent: A unique identifier for a dependent under the coverage.

        sequence: An optional counter for a particular instance of the identified coverage which
            increments upon each renewal.

        order: The order of applicability of this coverage relative to other coverages which
            are currently inforce. Note, there may be gaps in the numbering and this does
            not imply primary, secondard etc. as the specific positioning of coverages
            depends upon the episode of care.

        network: The insurer-specific identifier for the insurer-defined network of providers
            to which the beneficiary may seek treatment which will be covered at the 'in-
            network' rate, otherwise 'out of network' terms and conditions apply.

        contract: The policy(s) which constitute this insurance coverage.
