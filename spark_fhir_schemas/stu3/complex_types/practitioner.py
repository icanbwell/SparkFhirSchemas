        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Practitioner resource

        identifier: An identifier that applies to this person in this role.

        active: Whether this practitioner's record is in active use.

        name: The name(s) associated with the practitioner.

        telecom: A contact detail for the practitioner, e.g. a telephone number or an email
            address.

        address: Address(es) of the practitioner that are not role specific (typically home
            address).
            Work addresses are not typically entered in this property as they are usually
            role dependent.

        gender: Administrative Gender - the gender that the person is considered to have for
            administration and record keeping purposes.

        birthDate: The date of birth for the practitioner.

        photo: Image of the person.

        qualification: Qualifications obtained by training and certification.

        communication: A language the practitioner is able to use in patient communication.
