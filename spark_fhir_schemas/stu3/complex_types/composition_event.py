        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            documented is necessarily a "History and Physical" act.

        period: The period of time covered by the documentation. There is no assertion that
            the documentation is a complete representation for this period, only that it
            documents events during this time.

        detail: The description and/or reference of the event(s) being documented. For
            example, this could be used to document such a colonoscopy or an appendectomy.
