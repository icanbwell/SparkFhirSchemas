        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a DetectedIssue resource

        identifier: Business identifier associated with the detected issue record.

        status: Indicates the status of the detected issue.

        category: Identifies the general type of issue identified.

        severity: Indicates the degree of importance associated with the identified issue based
            on the potential impact on the patient.

        patient: Indicates the patient whose record the detected issue is associated with.

        date: The date or date-time when the detected issue was initially identified.

        author: Individual or device responsible for the issue being raised.  For example, a
            decision support application or a pharmacist conducting a medication review.

        implicated: Indicates the resource representing the current activity or proposed activity
            that is potentially problematic.

        detail: A textual explanation of the detected issue.

        reference: The literature, knowledge-base or similar reference that describes the
            propensity for the detected issue identified.

        mitigation: Indicates an action that has been taken or is committed to to reduce or
            eliminate the likelihood of the risk identified by the detected issue from
            manifesting.  Can also reflect an observation of known mitigating factors that
            may reduce/eliminate the need for any action.
