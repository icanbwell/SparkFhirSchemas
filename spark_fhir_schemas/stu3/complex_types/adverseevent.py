        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a AdverseEvent resource

        identifier: The identifier(s) of this adverse event that are assigned by business
            processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to the
            resource itsefl is not appropriate.

        category: The type of event which is important to characterize what occurred and caused
            harm to the subject, or had the potential to cause harm to the subject.

        type: This element defines the specific type of event that occurred or that was
            prevented from occurring.

        subject: This subject or group impacted by the event.  With a prospective adverse
            event, there will be no subject as the adverse event was prevented.

        date: The date (and perhaps time) when the adverse event occurred.

        reaction: Includes information about the reaction that occurred as a result of exposure
            to a substance (for example, a drug or a chemical).

        location: The information about where the adverse event occurred.

        seriousness: Describes the seriousness or severity of the adverse event.

        outcome: Describes the type of outcome from the adverse event.

        recorder: Information on who recorded the adverse event.  May be the patient or a
            practitioner.

        eventParticipant: Parties that may or should contribute or have contributed information to the
            Act. Such information includes information leading to the decision to perform
            the Act and how to perform the Act (e.g. consultant), information that the Act
            itself seeks to reveal (e.g. informant of clinical history), or information
            about what Act was performed (e.g. informant witness).

        description: Describes the adverse event in text.

        suspectEntity: Describes the entity that is suspected to have caused the adverse event.

        subjectMedicalHistory: AdverseEvent.subjectMedicalHistory.

        referenceDocument: AdverseEvent.referenceDocument.

        study: AdverseEvent.study.
