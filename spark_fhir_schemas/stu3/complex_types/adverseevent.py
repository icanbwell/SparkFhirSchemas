        resourceType: This is a AdverseEvent resource

        identifier: The identifier(s) of this adverse event that are assigned by business
            processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to the
            resource itsefl is not appropriate.

        category: The type of event which is important to characterize what occurred and caused
            harm to the subject, or had the potential to cause harm to the subject.

        type: This element defines the specific type of event that occurred or that was
            prevented from occurring.

        subject: This subject or group impacted by the event.  With a prospective adverse
            event, there will be no subject as the adverse event was prevented.

        date: The date (and perhaps time) when the adverse event occurred.

        reaction: Includes information about the reaction that occurred as a result of exposure
            to a substance (for example, a drug or a chemical).

        location: The information about where the adverse event occurred.

        seriousness: Describes the seriousness or severity of the adverse event.

        outcome: Describes the type of outcome from the adverse event.

        recorder: Information on who recorded the adverse event.  May be the patient or a
            practitioner.

        eventParticipant: Parties that may or should contribute or have contributed information to the
            Act. Such information includes information leading to the decision to perform
            the Act and how to perform the Act (e.g. consultant), information that the Act
            itself seeks to reveal (e.g. informant of clinical history), or information
            about what Act was performed (e.g. informant witness).

        description: Describes the adverse event in text.

        suspectEntity: Describes the entity that is suspected to have caused the adverse event.

        subjectMedicalHistory: AdverseEvent.subjectMedicalHistory.
