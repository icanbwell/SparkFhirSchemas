        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a ImagingStudy resource

        uid: Formal identifier for the study.

        accession: Accession Number is an identifier related to some aspect of imaging workflow
            and data management. Usage may vary across different institutions.  See for
            instance [IHE Radiology Technical Framework Volume 1 Appendix A](http://www.ih
            e.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_TF_Rev13.0_Vol1_FT_2014-07-30.
            pdf).

        identifier: Other identifiers for the study.

        availability: Availability of study (online, offline, or nearline).

        modalityList: A list of all the Series.ImageModality values that are actual acquisition
            modalities, i.e. those in the DICOM Context Group 29 (value set OID
            1.2.840.10008.6.1.19).

        patient: The patient imaged in the study.

        context: The encounter or episode at which the request is initiated.

        started: Date and time the study started.

        basedOn: A list of the diagnostic requests that resulted in this imaging study being
            performed.

        referrer: The requesting/referring physician.

        interpreter: Who read the study and interpreted the images or other content.

        endpoint: The network service providing access (e.g., query, view, or retrieval) for the
            study. See implementation notes for information about using DICOM endpoints. A
            study-level endpoint applies to each series in the study, unless overridden by
            a series-level endpoint with the same Endpoint.type.

        numberOfSeries: Number of Series in the Study. This value given may be larger than the number
            of series elements this Resource contains due to resource availability,
            security, or other factors. This element should be present if any series
            elements are present.

        numberOfInstances: Number of SOP Instances in Study. This value given may be larger than the
            number of instance elements this resource contains due to resource
            availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present if
            any instance elements are present.

        procedureReference: A reference to the performed Procedure.

        procedureCode: The code for the performed procedure type.

        reason: Description of clinical condition indicating why the ImagingStudy was
            requested.

        description: Institution-generated description or classification of the Study performed.

        series: Each study has one or more series of images or other content.
