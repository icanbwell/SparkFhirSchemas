        The MeasureReport resource contains the results of evaluating a measure.


        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a MeasureReport resource

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this report when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        status: The report status. No data will be available until the report status is
            complete.

        type: The type of measure report. This may be an individual report, which provides a
            single patient's score for the measure; a patient listing, which returns the
            list of patients that meet the various criteria in the measure; or a summary
            report, which returns a population count for each of the criteria in the
            measure.

        measure: A reference to the Measure that was evaluated to produce this report.

        patient: Optional Patient if the report was requested for a single patient.

        date: The date this measure report was generated.

        reportingOrganization: Reporting Organization.

        period: The reporting period for which the report was calculated.

        group: The results of the calculation, one for each population group in the measure.

        evaluatedResources: A reference to a Bundle containing the Resources that were used in the
            evaluation of this report.
