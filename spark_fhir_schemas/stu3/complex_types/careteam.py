        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a CareTeam resource

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this care team that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate.

        status: Indicates the current state of the care team.

        category: Identifies what kind of team.  This is to support differentiation between
            multiple co-existing teams, such as care plan team, episode of care team,
            longitudinal care team.

        name: A label for human use intended to distinguish like teams.  E.g. the "red" vs.
            "green" trauma teams.

        subject: Identifies the patient or group whose intended care is handled by the team.

        context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this care
            team.

        period: Indicates when the team did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.

        participant: Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the
            care team.

        reasonCode: Describes why the care team exists.

        reasonReference: Condition(s) that this care team addresses.

        managingOrganization: The organization responsible for the care team.

        note: Comments made about the CareTeam.
