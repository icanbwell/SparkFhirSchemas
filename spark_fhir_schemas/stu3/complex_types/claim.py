        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Claim resource

        identifier: The business identifier for the instance: claim number, pre-determination or
            pre-authorization number.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        type: The category of claim, eg, oral, pharmacy, vision, insitutional, professional.

        subType: A finer grained suite of claim subtype codes which may convey Inpatient vs
            Outpatient and/or a specialty service. In the US the BillType.

        use: Complete (Bill or Claim), Proposed (Pre-Authorization), Exploratory (Pre-
            determination).

        patient: Patient Resource.

        billablePeriod: The billable period for which charges are being submitted.

        created: The date when the enclosed suite of services were performed or completed.

        enterer: Person who created the invoice/claim/pre-determination or pre-authorization.

        insurer: The Insurer who is target of the request.

        provider: The provider which is responsible for the bill, claim pre-determination, pre-
            authorization.

        organization: The organization which is responsible for the bill, claim pre-determination,
            pre-authorization.

        priority: Immediate (STAT), best effort (NORMAL), deferred (DEFER).

        fundsReserve: In the case of a Pre-Determination/Pre-Authorization the provider may request
            that funds in the amount of the expected Benefit be reserved ('Patient' or
            'Provider') to pay for the Benefits determined on the subsequent claim(s).
            'None' explicitly indicates no funds reserving is requested.

        related: Other claims which are related to this claim such as prior claim versions or
            for related services.

        prescription: Prescription to support the dispensing of Pharmacy or Vision products.

        originalPrescription: Original prescription which has been superceded by this prescription to
            support the dispensing of pharmacy services, medications or products. For
            example, a physician may prescribe a medication which the pharmacy determines
            is contraindicated, or for which the patient has an intolerance, and therefor
            issues a new precription for an alternate medication which has the same
            theraputic intent. The prescription from the pharmacy becomes the
            'prescription' and that from the physician becomes the 'original
            prescription'.

        payee: The party to be reimbursed for the services.

        referral: The referral resource which lists the date, practitioner, reason and other

            jurisdiction specific valuesets which are required.

        diagnosis: List of patient diagnosis for which care is sought.

        procedure: Ordered list of patient procedures performed to support the adjudication.

        insurance: Financial instrument by which payment information for health care.

        accident: An accident which resulted in the need for healthcare services.

        employmentImpacted: The start and optional end dates of when the patient was precluded from
            working due to the treatable condition(s).

        hospitalization: The start and optional end dates of when the patient was confined to a
            treatment center.

        item: First tier of goods and services.

        total: The total value of the claim.
