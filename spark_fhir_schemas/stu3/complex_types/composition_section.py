        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        title: The label for this particular section.  This will be part of the rendered
            content for the document, and is often used to build a table of contents.

        code: A code identifying the kind of content contained within the section. This must
            be consistent with the section title.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains the attested content of the section,
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.

        mode: How the entry list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is
            suitable for being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a
            snapshot of a list of items from another source, or whether it is a prepared
            list where items may be marked as added, modified or deleted.

        orderedBy: Specifies the order applied to the items in the section entries.

        entry: A reference to the actual resource from which the narrative in the section is
            derived.

        emptyReason: If the section is empty, why the list is empty. An empty section typically has
            some text explaining the empty reason.

        section: A nested sub-section within this section.
