        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        severity: Indicates whether the issue indicates a variation from successful processing.

        code: Describes the type of the issue. The system that creates an OperationOutcome
            SHALL choose the most applicable code from the IssueType value set, and may
            additional provide its own code for the error in the details element.

        details: Additional details about the error. This may be a text description of the
            error, or a system code that identifies the error.

        diagnostics: Additional diagnostic information about the issue.  Typically, this may be a
            description of how a value is erroneous, or a stack dump to help trace the
            issue.

        location: For resource issues, this will be a simple XPath limited to element names,
            repetition indicators and the default child access that identifies one of the
            elements in the resource that caused this issue to be raised.  For HTTP
            errors, will be "http." + the parameter name.

        expression: A simple FHIRPath limited to element names, repetition indicators and the
            default child access that identifies one of the elements in the resource that
            caused this issue to be raised.
