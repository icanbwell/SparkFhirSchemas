        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        resourceType: This is a Bundle resource

        identifier: A persistent identifier for the batch that won't change as a batch is copied
            from server to server.

        type: Indicates the purpose of this bundle - how it was intended to be used.

        total: If a set of search matches, this is the total number of matches for the search
            (as opposed to the number of results in this bundle).

        link: A series of links that provide context to this bundle.

        entry: An entry in a bundle resource - will either contain a resource, or information
            about a resource (transactions and history only).

        signature: Digital Signature - base64 encoded. XML-DSIg or a JWT.
