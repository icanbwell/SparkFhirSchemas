        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Subscription resource

        status: The status of the subscription, which marks the server state for managing the
            subscription.

        contact: Contact details for a human to contact about the subscription. The primary use
            of this for system administrator troubleshooting.

        end: The time for the server to turn the subscription off.

        reason: A description of why this subscription is defined.

        criteria: The rules that the server should use to determine when to generate
            notifications for this subscription.

        error: A record of the last error that occurred when the server processed a
            notification.

        channel: Details where to send notifications when resources are received that meet the
            criteria.

        tag: A tag to add to any resource that matches the criteria, after the subscription
            is processed.
