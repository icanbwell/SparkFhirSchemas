        phraseology and grouping to allow coherent, consistent data collection.


        resourceType: This is a Questionnaire resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this questionnaire when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this questionnaire is
            (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference.
            It SHALL remain the same when the questionnaire is stored on different
            servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this questionnaire when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the questionnaire when
            it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
            arbitrary value managed by the questionnaire author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the questionnaire. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the questionnaire.

        derivedFrom: The URL of a Questionnaire that this Questionnaire is based on.

        status: The status of this questionnaire. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this questionnaire is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        subjectType: The types of subjects that can be the subject of responses created for the
            questionnaire.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the questionnaire was published. The date
            must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status
            code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of
            the questionnaire changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the questionnaire.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the questionnaire from a
            consumer's perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate
            questionnaire instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the questionnaire is intended to be
            used.

        purpose: Explanation of why this questionnaire is needed and why it has been designed
            as it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the questionnaire and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the questionnaire.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the questionnaire content was or is planned to be in
            active use.

        code: An identifier for this question or group of questions in a particular
            terminology such as LOINC.

        item: A particular question, question grouping or display text that is part of the
            questionnaire.
