        resourceType: This is a RiskAssessment resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: Business identifier assigned to the risk assessment.

        basedOn: A reference to the request that is fulfilled by this risk assessment.

        parent: A reference to a resource that this risk assessment is part of, such as a
            Procedure.

        status: The status of the RiskAssessment, using the same statuses as an Observation.

        method: The algorithm, process or mechanism used to evaluate the risk.

        code: The type of the risk assessment performed.

        subject: The patient or group the risk assessment applies to.

        encounter: The encounter where the assessment was performed.

        occurrenceDateTime: The date (and possibly time) the risk assessment was performed.

        occurrencePeriod: The date (and possibly time) the risk assessment was performed.

        condition: For assessments or prognosis specific to a particular condition, indicates the
            condition being assessed.

        performer: The provider or software application that performed the assessment.

        reasonCode: The reason the risk assessment was performed.

        reasonReference: Resources supporting the reason the risk assessment was performed.

        basis: Indicates the source data considered as part of the assessment (for example,
            FamilyHistory, Observations, Procedures, Conditions, etc.).

        prediction: Describes the expected outcome for the subject.

        mitigation: A description of the steps that might be taken to reduce the identified
            risk(s).

        note: Additional comments about the risk assessment.
