        An assessment of the likely outcome(s) for a patient or other subject as well

        resourceType: This is a RiskAssessment resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifier assigned to the risk assessment.

        basedOn: A reference to the request that is fulfilled by this risk assessment.

        parent: A reference to a resource that this risk assessment is part of, such as a
            Procedure.

        status: The status of the RiskAssessment, using the same statuses as an Observation.

        method: The algorithm, process or mechanism used to evaluate the risk.

        code: The type of the risk assessment performed.

        subject: The patient or group the risk assessment applies to.

        encounter: The encounter where the assessment was performed.

        occurrenceDateTime: The date (and possibly time) the risk assessment was performed.

        occurrencePeriod: The date (and possibly time) the risk assessment was performed.

        condition: For assessments or prognosis specific to a particular condition, indicates the
            condition being assessed.

        performer: The provider or software application that performed the assessment.

        reasonCode: The reason the risk assessment was performed.

        reasonReference: Resources supporting the reason the risk assessment was performed.

        basis: Indicates the source data considered as part of the assessment (for example,
            FamilyHistory, Observations, Procedures, Conditions, etc.).

        prediction: Describes the expected outcome for the subject.

        mitigation: A description of the steps that might be taken to reduce the identified
            risk(s).

        note: Additional comments about the risk assessment.
