        This resource provides the adjudication details from the processing of a Claim
        resource.


        resourceType: This is a ClaimResponse resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this claim response.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        type: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
            information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.

        subType: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
            information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.

        use: A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request
            adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting
            authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the
            non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be
            provided in the future.

        patient: The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied
            or are being considered and for whom actual for facast reimbursement is
            sought.

        created: The date this resource was created.

        insurer: The party responsible for authorization, adjudication and reimbursement.

        requestor: The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or
            preauthorization.

        request: Original request resource reference.

        outcome: The outcome of the claim, predetermination, or preauthorization processing.

        disposition: A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.

        preAuthRef: Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers
            to this adjudication.

        preAuthPeriod: The time frame during which this authorization is effective.

        payeeType: Type of Party to be reimbursed: subscriber, provider, other.

        item: A claim line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of details
            which can also be a simple items or groups of sub-details.

        addItem: The first-tier service adjudications for payor added product or service lines.

        adjudication: The adjudication results which are presented at the header level rather than
            at the line-item or add-item levels.

        total: Categorized monetary totals for the adjudication.

        payment: Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.

        fundsReserve: A code, used only on a response to a preauthorization, to indicate whether the
            benefits payable have been reserved and for whom.

        formCode: A code for the form to be used for printing the content.

        form: The actual form, by reference or inclusion, for printing the content or an
            EOB.

        processNote: A note that describes or explains adjudication results in a human readable
            form.

        communicationRequest: Request for additional supporting or authorizing information.

        insurance: Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and
            services specified on the claim.

        error: Errors encountered during the processing of the adjudication.
