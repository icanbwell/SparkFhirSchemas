        Catalog entries are wrappers that contextualize items included in a catalog.


        resourceType: This is a CatalogEntry resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Used in supporting different identifiers for the same product, e.g.
            manufacturer code and retailer code.

        type: The type of item - medication, device, service, protocol or other.

        orderable: Whether the entry represents an orderable item.

        referencedItem: The item in a catalog or definition.

        additionalIdentifier: Used in supporting related concepts, e.g. NDC to RxNorm.

        classification: Classes of devices, or ATC for medication.

        status: Used to support catalog exchange even for unsupported products, e.g. getting
            list of medications even if not prescribable.

        validityPeriod: The time period in which this catalog entry is expected to be active.

        validTo: The date until which this catalog entry is expected to be active.

        lastUpdated: Typically date of issue is different from the beginning of the validity. This
            can be used to see when an item was last updated.

        additionalCharacteristic: Used for examplefor Out of Formulary, or any specifics.

        additionalClassification: User for example for ATC classification, or.

        relatedEntry: Used for example, to point to a substance, or to a device used to administer a
            medication.
