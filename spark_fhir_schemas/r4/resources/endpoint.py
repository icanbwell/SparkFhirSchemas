        server. This may include any security context information.


        resourceType: This is a Endpoint resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the endpoint across
            multiple disparate systems.

        status: active | suspended | error | off | test.

        connectionType: A coded value that represents the technical details of the usage of this
            endpoint, such as what WSDLs should be used in what way. (e.g.
            XDS.b/DICOM/cds-hook).

        name: A friendly name that this endpoint can be referred to with.

        managingOrganization: The organization that manages this endpoint (even if technically another
            organization is hosting this in the cloud, it is the organization associated
            with the data).

        contact: Contact details for a human to contact about the subscription. The primary use
            of this for system administrator troubleshooting.

        period: The interval during which the endpoint is expected to be operational.

        payloadType: The payload type describes the acceptable content that can be communicated on
            the endpoint.

        payloadMimeType: The mime type to send the payload in - e.g. application/fhir+xml,
            application/fhir+json. If the mime type is not specified, then the sender
            could send any content (including no content depending on the connectionType).

        address: The uri that describes the actual end-point to connect to.

        header: Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification.
