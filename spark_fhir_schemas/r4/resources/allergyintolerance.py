        Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an
        individual and associated with exposure to a substance.


        resourceType: This is a AllergyIntolerance resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this AllergyIntolerance by the performer or
            other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates
            from server to server.

        clinicalStatus: The clinical status of the allergy or intolerance.

        verificationStatus: Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk,
            of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical product).

        type: Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction
            risk.

        category: Category of the identified substance.

        criticality: Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to
            the identified substance.

        code: Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a
            negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or
            pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse
            reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g.,
            "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class
            (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement
            (e.g.,  "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").  Note: the substance
            for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the
            cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be
            a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product
            that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only
            process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system
            is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within
            the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system
            should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.

        patient: The patient who has the allergy or intolerance.

        encounter: The encounter when the allergy or intolerance was asserted.

        onsetDateTime: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetAge: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetPeriod: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetRange: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        onsetString: Estimated or actual date,  date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was
            identified.

        recordedDate: The recordedDate represents when this particular AllergyIntolerance record was
            created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.

        recorder: Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.

        asserter: The source of the information about the allergy that is recorded.

        lastOccurrence: Represents the date and/or time of the last known occurrence of a reaction
            event.

        note: Additional narrative about the propensity for the Adverse Reaction, not
            captured in other fields.

        reaction: Details about each adverse reaction event linked to exposure to the identified
            substance.
