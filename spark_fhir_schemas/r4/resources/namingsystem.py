        A curated namespace that issues unique symbols within that namespace for the

        within the Identifier and Coding data types.


        resourceType: This is a NamingSystem resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        name: A natural language name identifying the naming system. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        status: The status of this naming system. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        kind: Indicates the purpose for the naming system - what kinds of things does it
            make unique?

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the naming system was published. The date
            must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status
            code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of
            the naming system changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the naming system.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        responsible: The name of the organization that is responsible for issuing identifiers or
            codes for this namespace and ensuring their non-collision.

        type: Categorizes a naming system for easier search by grouping related naming
            systems.

        description: A free text natural language description of the naming system from a
            consumer's perspective. Details about what the namespace identifies including
            scope, granularity, version labeling, etc.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate naming
            system instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the naming system is intended to be
            used.

        usage: Provides guidance on the use of the namespace, including the handling of
            formatting characters, use of upper vs. lower case, etc.

        uniqueId: Indicates how the system may be identified when referenced in electronic
            exchange.
