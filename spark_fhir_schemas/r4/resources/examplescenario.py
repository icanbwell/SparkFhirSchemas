        Example of workflow instance.


        resourceType: This is a ExampleScenario resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this example scenario when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this example scenario
            is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical
            reference. It SHALL remain the same when the example scenario is stored on
            different servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this example scenario when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the example scenario
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the example scenario author and is not expected
            to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
            a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the example scenario. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        status: The status of this example scenario. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this example scenario is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the example scenario was published. The
            date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the example scenario changes. (e.g. the 'content logical
            definition').

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the example
            scenario.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate example
            scenario instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the example scenario is intended to be
            used.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the example scenario and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the example scenario.

        purpose: What the example scenario resource is created for. This should not be used to
            show the business purpose of the scenario itself, but the purpose of
            documenting a scenario.

        actor: Actor participating in the resource.

        instance: Each resource and each version that is present in the workflow.

        process: Each major process - a group of operations.

        workflow: Another nested workflow.
