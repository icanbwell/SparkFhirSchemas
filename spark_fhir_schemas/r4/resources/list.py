        A list is a curated collection of resources.


        resourceType: This is a List resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifier for the List assigned for business purposes outside the context of
            FHIR.

        status: Indicates the current state of this list.

        mode: How this list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is suitable for
            being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a snapshot of a list
            of items from another source, or whether it is a prepared list where items may
            be marked as added, modified or deleted.

        title: A label for the list assigned by the author.

        code: This code defines the purpose of the list - why it was created.

        subject: The common subject (or patient) of the resources that are in the list if there
            is one.

        encounter: The encounter that is the context in which this list was created.

        date: The date that the list was prepared.

        source: The entity responsible for deciding what the contents of the list were. Where
            the list was created by a human, this is the same as the author of the list.

        orderedBy: What order applies to the items in the list.

        note: Comments that apply to the overall list.

        entry: Entries in this list.

        emptyReason: If the list is empty, why the list is empty.
