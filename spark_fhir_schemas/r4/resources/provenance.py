        resourceType: This is a Provenance resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        target: The Reference(s) that were generated or updated by  the activity described in
            this resource. A provenance can point to more than one target if multiple
            resources were created/updated by the same activity.

        occurredPeriod: The period during which the activity occurred.

        occurredDateTime: The period during which the activity occurred.

        recorded: The instant of time at which the activity was recorded.

        policy: Policy or plan the activity was defined by. Typically, a single activity may
            have multiple applicable policy documents, such as patient consent, guarantor
            funding, etc.

        location: Where the activity occurred, if relevant.

        reason: The reason that the activity was taking place.

        activity: An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or
            with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying,
            relocating, using, or generating entities.

        agent: An actor taking a role in an activity  for which it can be assigned some
            degree of responsibility for the activity taking place.

        entity: An entity used in this activity.

        signature: A digital signature on the target Reference(s). The signer should match a
            Provenance.agent. The purpose of the signature is indicated.
