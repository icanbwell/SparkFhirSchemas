        resourceType: This is a Provenance resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        target: The Reference(s) that were generated or updated by  the activity described in
            this resource. A provenance can point to more than one target if multiple
            resources were created/updated by the same activity.

        occurredPeriod: The period during which the activity occurred.

        occurredDateTime: The period during which the activity occurred.

        recorded: The instant of time at which the activity was recorded.

        policy: Policy or plan the activity was defined by. Typically, a single activity may
            have multiple applicable policy documents, such as patient consent, guarantor
            funding, etc.

        location: Where the activity occurred, if relevant.

        reason: The reason that the activity was taking place.

        activity: An activity is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or
            with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying,
            relocating, using, or generating entities.

        agent: An actor taking a role in an activity  for which it can be assigned some
            degree of responsibility for the activity taking place.

        entity: An entity used in this activity.

        signature: A digital signature on the target Reference(s). The signer should match a
            Provenance.agent. The purpose of the signature is indicated.
