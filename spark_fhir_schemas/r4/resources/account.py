        resourceType: This is a Account resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Unique identifier used to reference the account.  Might or might not be
            intended for human use (e.g. credit card number).

        status: Indicates whether the account is presently used/usable or not.

        type: Categorizes the account for reporting and searching purposes.

        name: Name used for the account when displaying it to humans in reports, etc.

        subject: Identifies the entity which incurs the expenses. While the immediate
            recipients of services or goods might be entities related to the subject, the
            expenses were ultimately incurred by the subject of the Account.

        servicePeriod: The date range of services associated with this account.

        coverage: The party(s) that are responsible for covering the payment of this account,
            and what order should they be applied to the account.

        owner: Indicates the service area, hospital, department, etc. with responsibility for
            managing the Account.

        description: Provides additional information about what the account tracks and how it is
            used.

        guarantor: The parties responsible for balancing the account if other payment options
            fall short.

        partOf: Reference to a parent Account.
