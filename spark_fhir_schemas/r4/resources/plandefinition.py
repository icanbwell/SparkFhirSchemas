        clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.


        resourceType: This is a PlanDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this plan definition when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this plan definition is
            (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference.
            It SHALL remain the same when the plan definition is stored on different
            servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this plan definition when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the plan definition
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the plan definition author and is not expected
            to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
            a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent
            with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format
            Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning
            knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note
            that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.

        name: A natural language name identifying the plan definition. This name should be
            usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
            as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the plan definition.

        subtitle: An explanatory or alternate title for the plan definition giving additional
            information about its content.

        type: A high-level category for the plan definition that distinguishes the kinds of
            systems that would be interested in the plan definition.

        status: The status of this plan definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
            content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this plan definition is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        subjectCodeableConcept: A code or group definition that describes the intended subject of the plan
            definition.

        subjectReference: A code or group definition that describes the intended subject of the plan
            definition.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the plan definition was published. The
            date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the
            status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the plan definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the plan definition.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the plan definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate plan
            definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the plan definition is intended to be
            used.

        purpose: Explanation of why this plan definition is needed and why it has been designed
            as it has.

        usage: A detailed description of how the plan definition is used from a clinical
            perspective.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the plan definition and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the plan definition.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the plan definition content was or is planned to be in
            active use.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the plan definition. Topics
            provide a high-level categorization of the definition that can be useful for
            filtering and searching.

        author: An individiual or organization primarily involved in the creation and
            maintenance of the content.

        editor: An individual or organization primarily responsible for internal coherence of
            the content.

        reviewer: An individual or organization primarily responsible for review of some aspect
            of the content.

        endorser: An individual or organization responsible for officially endorsing the content
            for use in some setting.

        relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        library: A reference to a Library resource containing any formal logic used by the plan
            definition.

        goal: Goals that describe what the activities within the plan are intended to
            achieve. For example, weight loss, restoring an activity of daily living,
            obtaining herd immunity via immunization, meeting a process improvement
            objective, etc.

        action: An action or group of actions to be taken as part of the plan.
