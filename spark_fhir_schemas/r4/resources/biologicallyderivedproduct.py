        resourceType: This is a BiologicallyDerivedProduct resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this biologically derived product
            instance that are defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it
            when a direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in
            CDA documents, or in written / printed documentation).

        productCategory: Broad category of this product.

        productCode: A code that identifies the kind of this biologically derived product (SNOMED
            Ctcode).

        status: Whether the product is currently available.

        request: Procedure request to obtain this biologically derived product.

        quantity: Number of discrete units within this product.

        parent: Parent product (if any).

        collection: How this product was collected.

        processing: Any processing of the product during collection that does not change the
            fundamental nature of the product. For example adding anti-coagulants during
            the collection of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells.

        manipulation: Any manipulation of product post-collection that is intended to alter the
            product.  For example a buffy-coat enrichment or CD8 reduction of Peripheral
            Blood Stem Cells to make it more suitable for infusion.

        storage: Product storage.
