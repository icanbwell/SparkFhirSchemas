        The interactions of the medicinal product with other medicinal products, or

        resourceType: This is a MedicinalProductInteraction resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        subject: The medication for which this is a described interaction.

        description: The interaction described.

        interactant: The specific medication, food or laboratory test that interacts.

        type: The type of the interaction e.g. drug-drug interaction, drug-food interaction,
            drug-lab test interaction.

        effect: The effect of the interaction, for example "reduced gastric absorption of
            primary medication".

        incidence: The incidence of the interaction, e.g. theoretical, observed.

        management: Actions for managing the interaction.
