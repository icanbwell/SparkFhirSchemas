        resourceType: This is a Claim resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this claim.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        type: The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional,
            professional.

        subType: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
            information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.

        use: A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request
            adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting
            authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the
            non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be
            provided in the future.

        patient: The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied
            or are being considered and for whom actual or forecast reimbursement is
            sought.

        billablePeriod: The period for which charges are being submitted.

        created: The date this resource was created.

        enterer: Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.

        insurer: The Insurer who is target of the request.

        provider: The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or
            preauthorization.

        priority: The provider-required urgency of processing the request. Typical values
            include: stat, routine deferred.

        fundsReserve: A code to indicate whether and for whom funds are to be reserved for future
            claims.

        related: Other claims which are related to this claim such as prior submissions or
            claims for related services or for the same event.

        prescription: Prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy, device or vision products.

        originalPrescription: Original prescription which has been superseded by this prescription to
            support the dispensing of pharmacy services, medications or products.

        payee: The party to be reimbursed for cost of the products and services according to
            the terms of the policy.

        referral: A reference to a referral resource.

        facility: Facility where the services were provided.

        careTeam: The members of the team who provided the products and services.

        supportingInfo: Additional information codes regarding exceptions, special considerations, the
            condition, situation, prior or concurrent issues.

        diagnosis: Information about diagnoses relevant to the claim items.

        procedure: Procedures performed on the patient relevant to the billing items with the
            claim.

        insurance: Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and
            services specified on the claim.

        accident: Details of an accident which resulted in injuries which required the products
            and services listed in the claim.

        item: A claim line. Either a simple  product or service or a 'group' of details
            which can each be a simple items or groups of sub-details.

        total: The total value of the all the items in the claim.
