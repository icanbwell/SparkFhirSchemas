        resourceType: This is a Claim resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this claim.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        type: The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional,
            professional.

        subType: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
            information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.

        use: A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request
            adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting
            authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the
            non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be
            provided in the future.

        patient: The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied
            or are being considered and for whom actual or forecast reimbursement is
            sought.

        billablePeriod: The period for which charges are being submitted.

        created: The date this resource was created.

        enterer: Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.

        insurer: The Insurer who is target of the request.

        provider: The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or
            preauthorization.

        priority: The provider-required urgency of processing the request. Typical values
            include: stat, routine deferred.

        fundsReserve: A code to indicate whether and for whom funds are to be reserved for future
            claims.

        related: Other claims which are related to this claim such as prior submissions or
            claims for related services or for the same event.

        prescription: Prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy, device or vision products.

        originalPrescription: Original prescription which has been superseded by this prescription to
            support the dispensing of pharmacy services, medications or products.

        payee: The party to be reimbursed for cost of the products and services according to
            the terms of the policy.

        referral: A reference to a referral resource.

        facility: Facility where the services were provided.

        careTeam: The members of the team who provided the products and services.

        supportingInfo: Additional information codes regarding exceptions, special considerations, the
            condition, situation, prior or concurrent issues.

        diagnosis: Information about diagnoses relevant to the claim items.

        procedure: Procedures performed on the patient relevant to the billing items with the
            claim.

        insurance: Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and
            services specified on the claim.

        accident: Details of an accident which resulted in injuries which required the products
            and services listed in the claim.

        item: A claim line. Either a simple  product or service or a 'group' of details
            which can each be a simple items or groups of sub-details.

        total: The total value of the all the items in the claim.
