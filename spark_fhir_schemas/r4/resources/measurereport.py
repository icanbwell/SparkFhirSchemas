        The MeasureReport resource contains the results of the calculation of a
        measure; and optionally a reference to the resources involved in that
        calculation.


        resourceType: This is a MeasureReport resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this MeasureReport when it is
            represented in other formats or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        status: The MeasureReport status. No data will be available until the MeasureReport
            status is complete.

        type: The type of measure report. This may be an individual report, which provides
            the score for the measure for an individual member of the population; a
            subject-listing, which returns the list of members that meet the various
            criteria in the measure; a summary report, which returns a population count
            for each of the criteria in the measure; or a data-collection, which enables
            the MeasureReport to be used to exchange the data-of-interest for a quality
            measure.

        measure: A reference to the Measure that was calculated to produce this report.

        subject: Optional subject identifying the individual or individuals the report is for.

        date: The date this measure report was generated.

        reporter: The individual, location, or organization that is reporting the data.

        period: The reporting period for which the report was calculated.

        improvementNotation: Whether improvement in the measure is noted by an increase or decrease in the
            measure score.

        group: The results of the calculation, one for each population group in the measure.

        evaluatedResource: A reference to a Bundle containing the Resources that were used in the
            calculation of this measure.
