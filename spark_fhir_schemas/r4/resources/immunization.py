        resourceType: This is a Immunization resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.

        status: Indicates the current status of the immunization event.

        statusReason: Indicates the reason the immunization event was not performed.

        vaccineCode: Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.

        patient: The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.

        encounter: The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care
            provider the immunization was performed as part of.

        occurrenceDateTime: Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.

        occurrenceString: Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.

        recorded: The date the occurrence of the immunization was first captured in the record -
            potentially significantly after the occurrence of the event.

        primarySource: An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the
            person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the
            data was originally recorded.

        reportOrigin: The source of the data when the report of the immunization event is not based
            on information from the person who administered the vaccine.

        location: The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.

        manufacturer: Name of vaccine manufacturer.

        lotNumber: Lot number of the  vaccine product.

        expirationDate: Date vaccine batch expires.

        site: Body site where vaccine was administered.

        route: The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.

        doseQuantity: The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.

        performer: Indicates who performed the immunization event.

        note: Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other
            attributes.

        reasonCode: Reasons why the vaccine was administered.

        reasonReference: Condition, Observation or DiagnosticReport that supports why the immunization
            was administered.

        isSubpotent: Indication if a dose is considered to be subpotent. By default, a dose should
            be considered to be potent.

        subpotentReason: Reason why a dose is considered to be subpotent.

        education: Educational material presented to the patient (or guardian) at the time of
            vaccine administration.

        programEligibility: Indicates a patient's eligibility for a funding program.

        fundingSource: Indicates the source of the vaccine actually administered. This may be
            different than the patient eligibility (e.g. the patient may be eligible for a
            publically purchased vaccine but due to inventory issues, vaccine purchased
            with private funds was actually administered).

        reaction: Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an
            immunization.

        protocolApplied: The protocol (set of recommendations) being followed by the provider who
            administered the dose.
