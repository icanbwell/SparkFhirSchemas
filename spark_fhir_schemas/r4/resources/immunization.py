        resourceType: This is a Immunization resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.

        status: Indicates the current status of the immunization event.

        statusReason: Indicates the reason the immunization event was not performed.

        vaccineCode: Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.

        patient: The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.

        encounter: The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care
            provider the immunization was performed as part of.

        occurrenceDateTime: Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.

        occurrenceString: Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.

        recorded: The date the occurrence of the immunization was first captured in the record -
            potentially significantly after the occurrence of the event.

        primarySource: An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the
            person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the
            data was originally recorded.

        reportOrigin: The source of the data when the report of the immunization event is not based
            on information from the person who administered the vaccine.

        location: The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.

        manufacturer: Name of vaccine manufacturer.

        lotNumber: Lot number of the  vaccine product.

        expirationDate: Date vaccine batch expires.

        site: Body site where vaccine was administered.

        route: The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.

        doseQuantity: The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.

        performer: Indicates who performed the immunization event.

        note: Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other
            attributes.

        reasonCode: Reasons why the vaccine was administered.

        reasonReference: Condition, Observation or DiagnosticReport that supports why the immunization
            was administered.

        isSubpotent: Indication if a dose is considered to be subpotent. By default, a dose should
            be considered to be potent.

        subpotentReason: Reason why a dose is considered to be subpotent.

        education: Educational material presented to the patient (or guardian) at the time of
            vaccine administration.

        programEligibility: Indicates a patient's eligibility for a funding program.

        fundingSource: Indicates the source of the vaccine actually administered. This may be
            different than the patient eligibility (e.g. the patient may be eligible for a
            publically purchased vaccine but due to inventory issues, vaccine purchased
            with private funds was actually administered).

        reaction: Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an
            immunization.

        protocolApplied: The protocol (set of recommendations) being followed by the provider who
            administered the dose.
