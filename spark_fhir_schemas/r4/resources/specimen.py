        resourceType: This is a Specimen resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Id for specimen.

        accessionIdentifier: The identifier assigned by the lab when accessioning specimen(s). This is not
            necessarily the same as the specimen identifier, depending on local lab
            procedures.

        status: The availability of the specimen.

        type: The kind of material that forms the specimen.

        subject: Where the specimen came from. This may be from patient(s), from a location
            (e.g., the source of an environmental sample), or a sampling of a substance or
            a device.

        receivedTime: Time when specimen was received for processing or testing.

        parent: Reference to the parent (source) specimen which is used when the specimen was
            either derived from or a component of another specimen.

        request: Details concerning a service request that required a specimen to be collected.

        collection: Details concerning the specimen collection.

        processing: Details concerning processing and processing steps for the specimen.

        container: The container holding the specimen.  The recursive nature of containers; i.e.
            blood in tube in tray in rack is not addressed here.

        condition: A mode or state of being that describes the nature of the specimen.

        note: To communicate any details or issues about the specimen or during the specimen
            collection. (for example: broken vial, sent with patient, frozen).
