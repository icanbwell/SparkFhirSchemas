        resourceType: This is a Contract resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: Unique identifier for this Contract or a derivative that references a Source
            Contract.

        url: Canonical identifier for this contract, represented as a URI (globally
            unique).

        version: An edition identifier used for business purposes to label business significant
            variants.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        legalState: Legal states of the formation of a legal instrument, which is a formally
            executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author,
            records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or
            contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act,
            process, or agreement.

        instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined Contract Definition that is adhered to in
            whole or part by this Contract.

        instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained definition that is adhered to in
            whole or in part by this Contract.

        contentDerivative: The minimal content derived from the basal information source at a specific
            stage in its lifecycle.

        issued: When this  Contract was issued.

        applies: Relevant time or time-period when this Contract is applicable.

        expirationType: Event resulting in discontinuation or termination of this Contract instance by
            one or more parties to the contract.

        subject: The target entity impacted by or of interest to parties to the agreement.

        authority: A formally or informally recognized grouping of people, principals,
            organizations, or jurisdictions formed for the purpose of achieving some form
            of collective action such as the promulgation, administration and enforcement
