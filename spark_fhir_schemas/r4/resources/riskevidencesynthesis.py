        The RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource describes the likelihood of an outcome in a
        population plus exposure state where the risk estimate is derived from a
        combination of research studies.


        resourceType: This is a RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this risk evidence synthesis when it
            is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
            its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
            literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this risk
            evidence synthesis is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
            canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the risk evidence synthesis
            is stored on different servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this risk evidence synthesis when
            it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
            design or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the risk evidence
            synthesis when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
            This is an arbitrary value managed by the risk evidence synthesis author and
            is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp
            (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no
            expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the risk evidence synthesis. This name
            should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
            applications such as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the risk evidence synthesis.

        status: The status of this risk evidence synthesis. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
            the content.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the risk evidence synthesis was
            published. The date must change when the business version changes and it must
            change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
            substantive content of the risk evidence synthesis changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the risk evidence
            synthesis.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the risk evidence synthesis from a
            consumer's perspective.

        note: A human-readable string to clarify or explain concepts about the resource.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate risk
            evidence synthesis instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the risk evidence synthesis is intended
            to be used.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the risk evidence synthesis and/or its
            contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the risk evidence synthesis.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the risk evidence synthesis content was or is planned
            to be in active use.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the RiskEvidenceSynthesis. Topics
            provide a high-level categorization grouping types of EffectEvidenceSynthesiss
            that can be useful for filtering and searching.

        author: An individiual or organization primarily involved in the creation and
            maintenance of the content.

        editor: An individual or organization primarily responsible for internal coherence of
            the content.

        reviewer: An individual or organization primarily responsible for review of some aspect
            of the content.

        endorser: An individual or organization responsible for officially endorsing the content
            for use in some setting.

        relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        synthesisType: Type of synthesis eg meta-analysis.

        studyType: Type of study eg randomized trial.

        population: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the population for the
            research.

        exposure: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the exposure for the
            research.

        outcome: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resomece that defines the outcome for the
            research.

        sampleSize: A description of the size of the sample involved in the synthesis.

        riskEstimate: The estimated risk of the outcome.

        certainty: A description of the certainty of the risk estimate.
