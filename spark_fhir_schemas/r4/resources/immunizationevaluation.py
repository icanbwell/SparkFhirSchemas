        """
        Describes a comparison of an immunization event against published
        recommendations to determine if the administration is "valid" in relation to
        those  recommendations.


        resourceType: This is a ImmunizationEvaluation resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization evaluation record.

        status: Indicates the current status of the evaluation of the vaccination
            administration event.

        patient: The individual for whom the evaluation is being done.

        date: The date the evaluation of the vaccine administration event was performed.

        authority: Indicates the authority who published the protocol (e.g. ACIP).

        targetDisease: The vaccine preventable disease the dose is being evaluated against.

        immunizationEvent: The vaccine administration event being evaluated.

        doseStatus: Indicates if the dose is valid or not valid with respect to the published
            recommendations.

        doseStatusReason: Provides an explanation as to why the vaccine administration event is valid or
            not relative to the published recommendations.

        description: Additional information about the evaluation.

        series: One possible path to achieve presumed immunity against a disease - within the
            context of an authority.

        doseNumberPositiveInt: Nominal position in a series.

        doseNumberString: Nominal position in a series.

        seriesDosesPositiveInt: The recommended number of doses to achieve immunity.

        seriesDosesString: The recommended number of doses to achieve immunity.
