        This resource provides enrollment and plan details from the processing of an

        resourceType: This is a EnrollmentResponse resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: The Response business identifier.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        request: Original request resource reference.

        outcome: Processing status: error, complete.

        disposition: A description of the status of the adjudication.

        created: The date when the enclosed suite of services were performed or completed.

        organization: The Insurer who produced this adjudicated response.

        requestProvider: The practitioner who is responsible for the services rendered to the patient.
