        Describes validation requirements, source(s), status and dates for one or more
        elements.


        resourceType: This is a VerificationResult resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        target: A resource that was validated.

        targetLocation: The fhirpath location(s) within the resource that was validated.

        need: The frequency with which the target must be validated (none; initial;
            periodic).

        status: The validation status of the target (attested; validated; in process; requires
            revalidation; validation failed; revalidation failed).

        statusDate: When the validation status was updated.

        validationType: What the target is validated against (nothing; primary source; multiple
            sources).

        validationProcess: The primary process by which the target is validated (edit check; value set;
            primary source; multiple sources; standalone; in context).

        frequency: Frequency of revalidation.

        lastPerformed: The date/time validation was last completed (including failed validations).

        nextScheduled: The date when target is next validated, if appropriate.

        failureAction: The result if validation fails (fatal; warning; record only; none).

        primarySource: Information about the primary source(s) involved in validation.

        attestation: Information about the entity attesting to information.

        validator: Information about the entity validating information.
