        A record of a request for a medication, substance or device used in the

        resourceType: This is a SupplyRequest resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this SupplyRequest by the author and/or other
            systems. These identifiers remain constant as the resource is updated and
            propagates from server to server.

        status: Status of the supply request.

        category: Category of supply, e.g.  central, non-stock, etc. This is used to support
            work flows associated with the supply process.

        priority: Indicates how quickly this SupplyRequest should be addressed with respect to
            other requests.

        itemCodeableConcept: The item that is requested to be supplied. This is either a link to a resource
            representing the details of the item or a code that identifies the item from a
            known list.

        itemReference: The item that is requested to be supplied. This is either a link to a resource
            representing the details of the item or a code that identifies the item from a
            known list.

        quantity: The amount that is being ordered of the indicated item.

        parameter: Specific parameters for the ordered item.  For example, the size of the
            indicated item.

        occurrenceDateTime: When the request should be fulfilled.

        occurrencePeriod: When the request should be fulfilled.

        occurrenceTiming: When the request should be fulfilled.

        authoredOn: When the request was made.

        requester: The device, practitioner, etc. who initiated the request.

        supplier: Who is intended to fulfill the request.

        reasonCode: The reason why the supply item was requested.

        reasonReference: The reason why the supply item was requested.

        deliverFrom: Where the supply is expected to come from.

        deliverTo: Where the supply is destined to go.
