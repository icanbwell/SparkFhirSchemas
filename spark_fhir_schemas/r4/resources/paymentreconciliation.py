        This resource provides the details including amount of a payment and allocates

        resourceType: This is a PaymentReconciliation resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this payment reconciliation.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        period: The period of time for which payments have been gathered into this bulk
            payment for settlement.

        created: The date when the resource was created.

        paymentIssuer: The party who generated the payment.

        request: Original request resource reference.

        requestor: The practitioner who is responsible for the services rendered to the patient.

        outcome: The outcome of a request for a reconciliation.

        disposition: A human readable description of the status of the request for the
            reconciliation.

        paymentDate: The date of payment as indicated on the financial instrument.

        paymentAmount: Total payment amount as indicated on the financial instrument.

        paymentIdentifier: Issuer's unique identifier for the payment instrument.

        detail: Distribution of the payment amount for a previously acknowledged payable.

        formCode: A code for the form to be used for printing the content.

        processNote: A note that describes or explains the processing in a human readable form.
