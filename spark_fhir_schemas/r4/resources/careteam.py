        resourceType: This is a CareTeam resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this care team by the performer or other
            systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from
            server to server.

        status: Indicates the current state of the care team.

        category: Identifies what kind of team.  This is to support differentiation between
            multiple co-existing teams, such as care plan team, episode of care team,
            longitudinal care team.

        name: A label for human use intended to distinguish like teams.  E.g. the "red" vs.
            "green" trauma teams.

        subject: Identifies the patient or group whose intended care is handled by the team.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this CareTeam was created or to which the creation
            of this record is tightly associated.

        period: Indicates when the team did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.

        participant: Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the
            care team.

        reasonCode: Describes why the care team exists.

        reasonReference: Condition(s) that this care team addresses.

        managingOrganization: The organization responsible for the care team.

        telecom: A central contact detail for the care team (that applies to all members).

        note: Comments made about the CareTeam.
