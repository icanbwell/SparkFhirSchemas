        of the questionnaire being responded to.


        resourceType: This is a QuestionnaireResponse resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: A business identifier assigned to a particular completed (or partially
            completed) questionnaire.

        basedOn: The order, proposal or plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this
            QuestionnaireResponse.  For example, a ServiceRequest seeking an intake
            assessment or a decision support recommendation to assess for post-partum
            depression.

        partOf: A procedure or observation that this questionnaire was performed as part of
            the execution of.  For example, the surgery a checklist was executed as part
            of.

        questionnaire: The Questionnaire that defines and organizes the questions for which answers
            are being provided.

        status: The position of the questionnaire response within its overall lifecycle.

        subject: The subject of the questionnaire response.  This could be a patient,
            organization, practitioner, device, etc.  This is who/what the answers apply
            to, but is not necessarily the source of information.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this questionnaire response was created or to which
            the creation of this record is tightly associated.

        authored: The date and/or time that this set of answers were last changed.

        author: Person who received the answers to the questions in the QuestionnaireResponse
            and recorded them in the system.

        source: The person who answered the questions about the subject.

        item: A group or question item from the original questionnaire for which answers are
            provided.
