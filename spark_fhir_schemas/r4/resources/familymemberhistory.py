        resourceType: This is a FamilyMemberHistory resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this family member history by the performer
            or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and
            propagates from server to server.

        instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
            definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this FamilyMemberHistory.

        instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
            other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this
            FamilyMemberHistory.

        status: A code specifying the status of the record of the family history of a specific
            family member.

        dataAbsentReason: Describes why the family member's history is not available.

        patient: The person who this history concerns.

        date: The date (and possibly time) when the family member history was recorded or
            last updated.

        name: This will either be a name or a description; e.g. "Aunt Susan", "my cousin
            with the red hair".

        relationship: The type of relationship this person has to the patient (father, mother,
            brother etc.).

        sex: The birth sex of the family member.

        bornPeriod: The actual or approximate date of birth of the relative.

        bornDate: The actual or approximate date of birth of the relative.

        bornString: The actual or approximate date of birth of the relative.

        ageAge: The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded.

        ageRange: The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded.

        ageString: The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded.

        estimatedAge: If true, indicates that the age value specified is an estimated value.

        deceasedBoolean: Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of
            death for the family member history record.

        deceasedAge: Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of
            death for the family member history record.

        deceasedRange: Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of
            death for the family member history record.

        deceasedDate: Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of
            death for the family member history record.

        deceasedString: Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of
            death for the family member history record.

        reasonCode: Describes why the family member history occurred in coded or textual form.

        reasonReference: Indicates a Condition, Observation, AllergyIntolerance, or
            QuestionnaireResponse that justifies this family member history event.

        note: This property allows a non condition-specific note to the made about the
            related person. Ideally, the note would be in the condition property, but this
            is not always possible.

        condition: The significant Conditions (or condition) that the family member had. This is
            a repeating section to allow a system to represent more than one condition per
            resource, though there is nothing stopping multiple resources - one per
            condition.
