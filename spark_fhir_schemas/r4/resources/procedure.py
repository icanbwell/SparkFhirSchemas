        resourceType: This is a Procedure resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this procedure by the performer or other
            systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and is propagated
            from server to server.

        instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, order set or other
            definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Procedure.

        instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, order set or
            other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Procedure.

        basedOn: A reference to a resource that contains details of the request for this
            procedure.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular procedure is a component or step.

        status: A code specifying the state of the procedure. Generally, this will be the in-
            progress or completed state.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the procedure.

        category: A code that classifies the procedure for searching, sorting and display
            purposes (e.g. "Surgical Procedure").

        code: The specific procedure that is performed. Use text if the exact nature of the
            procedure cannot be coded (e.g. "Laparoscopic Appendectomy").

        subject: The person, animal or group on which the procedure was performed.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this Procedure was created or performed or to which
            the creation of this record is tightly associated.

        performedDateTime: Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was
            performed.  Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than
            one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        performedPeriod: Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was
            performed.  Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than
            one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        performedString: Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was
            performed.  Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than
            one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        performedAge: Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was
            performed.  Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than
            one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        performedRange: Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was
            performed.  Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than
            one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.

        recorder: Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.

        asserter: Individual who is making the procedure statement.

        performer: Limited to "real" people rather than equipment.

        location: The location where the procedure actually happened.  E.g. a newborn at home, a
            tracheostomy at a restaurant.

        reasonCode: The coded reason why the procedure was performed. This may be a coded entity
            of some type, or may simply be present as text.

        reasonReference: The justification of why the procedure was performed.

        bodySite: Detailed and structured anatomical location information. Multiple locations
            are allowed - e.g. multiple punch biopsies of a lesion.

        outcome: The outcome of the procedure - did it resolve the reasons for the procedure
            being performed?

        report: This could be a histology result, pathology report, surgical report, etc.

        complication: Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate
            post-performance period. These are generally tracked separately from the
            notes, which will typically describe the procedure itself rather than any
            'post procedure' issues.

        complicationDetail: Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate
            post-performance period.

        followUp: If the procedure required specific follow up - e.g. removal of sutures. The
            follow up may be represented as a simple note or could potentially be more
            complex, in which case the CarePlan resource can be used.

        note: Any other notes and comments about the procedure.

        focalDevice: A device that is implanted, removed or otherwise manipulated (calibration,
            battery replacement, fitting a prosthesis, attaching a wound-vac, etc.) as a
            focal portion of the Procedure.

        usedReference: Identifies medications, devices and any other substance used as part of the
            procedure.

        usedCode: Identifies coded items that were used as part of the procedure.
