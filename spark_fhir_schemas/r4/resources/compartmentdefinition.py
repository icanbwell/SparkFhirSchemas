        """
        A compartment definition that defines how resources are accessed on a server.


        resourceType: This is a CompartmentDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this compartment definition when it
            is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
            its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
            literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this
            compartment definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target
            of a canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the compartment
            definition is stored on different servers.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the compartment
            definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
            instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the compartment definition
            author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
            timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also
            no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the compartment definition. This name
            should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
            applications such as code generation.

        status: The status of this compartment definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
            the content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this compartment definition is authored for
            testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
            used for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the compartment definition was published.
            The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
            the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the compartment definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the compartment
            definition.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the compartment definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate compartment
            definition instances.

        purpose: Explanation of why this compartment definition is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        code: Which compartment this definition describes.

        search: Whether the search syntax is supported,.

        resource: Information about how a resource is related to the compartment.
