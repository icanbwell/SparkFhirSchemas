        resourceType: This is a ChargeItemDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this charge item definition when it
            is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
            its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
            literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this charge
            item definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
            canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the charge item definition
            is stored on different servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this charge item definition when
            it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
            design or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the charge item
            definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
            instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the charge item definition
            author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
            timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also
            no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To
            provide a version consistent with the Decision Support Service specification,
            use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on
            versioning knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service
            specification. Note that a version is required for non-experimental active
            assets.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the charge item definition.

        derivedFromUri: The URL pointing to an externally-defined charge item definition that is
            adhered to in whole or in part by this definition.

        partOf: A larger definition of which this particular definition is a component or
            step.

        replaces: As new versions of a protocol or guideline are defined, allows identification
            of what versions are replaced by a new instance.

        status: The current state of the ChargeItemDefinition.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this charge item definition is authored for
            testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
            used for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the charge item definition was published.
            The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
            the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the charge item definition changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the charge item
            definition.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the charge item definition from a
            consumer's perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate charge item
            definition instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the charge item definition is intended
            to be used.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the charge item definition and/or its
            contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the charge item definition.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the charge item definition content was or is planned
            to be in active use.

        code: The defined billing details in this resource pertain to the given billing
            code.

        instance: The defined billing details in this resource pertain to the given product
            instance(s).

        applicability: Expressions that describe applicability criteria for the billing code.

        propertyGroup: Group of properties which are applicable under the same conditions. If no
            applicability rules are established for the group, then all properties always
            apply.
