        resourceType: This is a InsurancePlan resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this health insurance product which remain
            constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.

        status: The current state of the health insurance product.

        type: The kind of health insurance product.

        name: Official name of the health insurance product as designated by the owner.

        alias: A list of alternate names that the product is known as, or was known as in the
            past.

        period: The period of time that the health insurance product is available.

        ownedBy: The entity that is providing  the health insurance product and underwriting
            the risk.  This is typically an insurance carriers, other third-party payers,
            or health plan sponsors comonly referred to as 'payers'.

        administeredBy: An organization which administer other services such as underwriting, customer
            service and/or claims processing on behalf of the health insurance product
            owner.

        coverageArea: The geographic region in which a health insurance product's benefits apply.

        contact: The contact for the health insurance product for a certain purpose.

        endpoint: The technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the health
            insurance product.

        network: Reference to the network included in the health insurance product.

        coverage: Details about the coverage offered by the insurance product.

        plan: Details about an insurance plan.
