        resourceType: This is a PractitionerRole resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business Identifiers that are specific to a role/location.

        active: Whether this practitioner role record is in active use.

        period: The period during which the person is authorized to act as a practitioner in
            these role(s) for the organization.

        practitioner: Practitioner that is able to provide the defined services for the
            organization.

        organization: The organization where the Practitioner performs the roles associated.

        code: Roles which this practitioner is authorized to perform for the organization.

        specialty: Specific specialty of the practitioner.

        location: The location(s) at which this practitioner provides care.

        healthcareService: The list of healthcare services that this worker provides for this role's
            Organization/Location(s).

        telecom: Contact details that are specific to the role/location/service.

        availableTime: A collection of times the practitioner is available or performing this role at
            the location and/or healthcareservice.

        notAvailable: The practitioner is not available or performing this role during this period
            of time due to the provided reason.

        availabilityExceptions: A description of site availability exceptions, e.g. public holiday
            availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to normal site
            availability as details in the available Times and not available Times.

        endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the practitioner
            with this role.
