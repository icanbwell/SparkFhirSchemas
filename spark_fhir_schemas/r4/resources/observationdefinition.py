        resourceType: This is a ObservationDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        category: A code that classifies the general type of observation.

        code: Describes what will be observed. Sometimes this is called the observation
            "name".

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this ObservationDefinition artifact.

        permittedDataType: The data types allowed for the value element of the instance observations
            conforming to this ObservationDefinition.

        multipleResultsAllowed: Multiple results allowed for observations conforming to this
            ObservationDefinition.

        method: The method or technique used to perform the observation.

        preferredReportName: The preferred name to be used when reporting the results of observations
            conforming to this ObservationDefinition.

        quantitativeDetails: Characteristics for quantitative results of this observation.

        qualifiedInterval: Multiple  ranges of results qualified by different contexts for ordinal or
            continuous observations conforming to this ObservationDefinition.

        validCodedValueSet: The set of valid coded results for the observations  conforming to this
            ObservationDefinition.

        normalCodedValueSet: The set of normal coded results for the observations conforming to this
            ObservationDefinition.

        abnormalCodedValueSet: The set of abnormal coded results for the observation conforming to this
            ObservationDefinition.

        criticalCodedValueSet: The set of critical coded results for the observation conforming to this
            ObservationDefinition.
