        resourceType: This is a Evidence resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this evidence when it is referenced
            in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical
            identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at
            which at which an authoritative instance of this evidence is (or will be)
            published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL
            remain the same when the evidence is stored on different servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this evidence when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the evidence when it
            is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
            arbitrary value managed by the evidence author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent
            with the Decision Support Service specification, use the format
            Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning
            knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification. Note
            that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.

        name: A natural language name identifying the evidence. This name should be usable
            as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as
            code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the evidence.

        shortTitle: The short title provides an alternate title for use in informal descriptive
            contexts where the full, formal title is not necessary.

        subtitle: An explanatory or alternate title for the Evidence giving additional
            information about its content.

        status: The status of this evidence. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the evidence was published. The date must
            change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code
            changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the
            evidence changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the evidence.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the evidence from a consumer's
            perspective.

        note: A human-readable string to clarify or explain concepts about the resource.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate evidence
            instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the evidence is intended to be used.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the evidence and/or its contents. Copyright
            statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and publishing of the
            evidence.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the evidence content was or is planned to be in active
            use.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the Evidence. Topics provide a
            high-level categorization grouping types of Evidences that can be useful for
            filtering and searching.

        author: An individiual or organization primarily involved in the creation and
            maintenance of the content.

        editor: An individual or organization primarily responsible for internal coherence of
            the content.

        reviewer: An individual or organization primarily responsible for review of some aspect
            of the content.

        endorser: An individual or organization responsible for officially endorsing the content
            for use in some setting.

        relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        exposureBackground: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the population for the
            research.

        exposureVariant: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the exposure for the
            research.

        outcome: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resomece that defines the outcome for the
            research.
