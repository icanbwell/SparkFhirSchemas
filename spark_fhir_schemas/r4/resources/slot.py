        A slot of time on a schedule that may be available for booking appointments.


        resourceType: This is a Slot resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: External Ids for this item.

        serviceCategory: A broad categorization of the service that is to be performed during this
            appointment.

        serviceType: The type of appointments that can be booked into this slot (ideally this would
            be an identifiable service - which is at a location, rather than the location
            itself). If provided then this overrides the value provided on the
            availability resource.

        specialty: The specialty of a practitioner that would be required to perform the service
            requested in this appointment.

        appointmentType: The style of appointment or patient that may be booked in the slot (not
            service type).

        schedule: The schedule resource that this slot defines an interval of status
            information.

        status: busy | free | busy-unavailable | busy-tentative | entered-in-error.

        start: Date/Time that the slot is to begin.

        end: Date/Time that the slot is to conclude.

        overbooked: This slot has already been overbooked, appointments are unlikely to be
            accepted for this time.

        comment: Comments on the slot to describe any extended information. Such as custom
            constraints on the slot.
