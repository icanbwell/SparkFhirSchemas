        resourceType: This is a ChargeItem resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifiers assigned to this event performer or other systems.

        definitionUri: References the (external) source of pricing information, rules of application
            for the code this ChargeItem uses.

        definitionCanonical: References the source of pricing information, rules of application for the
            code this ChargeItem uses.

        status: The current state of the ChargeItem.

        partOf: ChargeItems can be grouped to larger ChargeItems covering the whole set.

        code: A code that identifies the charge, like a billing code.

        subject: The individual or set of individuals the action is being or was performed on.

        context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this event.

        occurrenceDateTime: Date/time(s) or duration when the charged service was applied.

        occurrencePeriod: Date/time(s) or duration when the charged service was applied.

        occurrenceTiming: Date/time(s) or duration when the charged service was applied.

        performer: Indicates who or what performed or participated in the charged service.

        performingOrganization: The organization requesting the service.

        requestingOrganization: The organization performing the service.

        costCenter: The financial cost center permits the tracking of charge attribution.

        quantity: Quantity of which the charge item has been serviced.

        bodysite: The anatomical location where the related service has been applied.

        factorOverride: Factor overriding the factor determined by the rules associated with the code.

        priceOverride: Total price of the charge overriding the list price associated with the code.

        overrideReason: If the list price or the rule-based factor associated with the code is
            overridden, this attribute can capture a text to indicate the  reason for this
            action.

        enterer: The device, practitioner, etc. who entered the charge item.

        enteredDate: Date the charge item was entered.

        reason: Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.

        service: Indicated the rendered service that caused this charge.

        productReference: Identifies the device, food, drug or other product being charged either by
            type code or reference to an instance.

        productCodeableConcept: Identifies the device, food, drug or other product being charged either by
            type code or reference to an instance.

        account: Account into which this ChargeItems belongs.

        note: Comments made about the event by the performer, subject or other participants.

        supportingInformation: Further information supporting this charge.
