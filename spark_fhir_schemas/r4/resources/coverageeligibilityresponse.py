        This resource provides eligibility and plan details from the processing of an
        CoverageEligibilityRequest resource.


        resourceType: This is a CoverageEligibilityResponse resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this coverage eligiblity request.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        purpose: Code to specify whether requesting: prior authorization requirements for some
            service categories or billing codes; benefits for coverages specified or
            discovered; discovery and return of coverages for the patient; and/or
            validation that the specified coverage is in-force at the date/period
            specified or 'now' if not specified.

        patient: The party who is the beneficiary of the supplied coverage and for whom
            eligibility is sought.

        servicedDate: The date or dates when the enclosed suite of services were performed or
            completed.

        servicedPeriod: The date or dates when the enclosed suite of services were performed or
            completed.

        created: The date this resource was created.

        requestor: The provider which is responsible for the request.

        request: Reference to the original request resource.

        outcome: The outcome of the request processing.

        disposition: A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.

        insurer: The Insurer who issued the coverage in question and is the author of the
            response.

        insurance: Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and
            services.

        preAuthRef: A reference from the Insurer to which these services pertain to be used on
            further communication and as proof that the request occurred.

        form: A code for the form to be used for printing the content.

        error: Errors encountered during the processing of the request.
