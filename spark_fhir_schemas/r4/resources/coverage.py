        resourceType: This is a Coverage resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this coverage.

        status: The status of the resource instance.

        type: The type of coverage: social program, medical plan, accident coverage (workers
            compensation, auto), group health or payment by an individual or organization.

        policyHolder: The party who 'owns' the insurance policy.

        subscriber: The party who has signed-up for or 'owns' the contractual relationship to the
            policy or to whom the benefit of the policy for services rendered to them or
            their family is due.

        subscriberId: The insurer assigned ID for the Subscriber.

        beneficiary: The party who benefits from the insurance coverage; the patient when products
            and/or services are provided.

        dependent: A unique identifier for a dependent under the coverage.

        relationship: The relationship of beneficiary (patient) to the subscriber.

        period: Time period during which the coverage is in force. A missing start date
            indicates the start date isn't known, a missing end date means the coverage is
            continuing to be in force.

        payor: The program or plan underwriter or payor including both insurance and non-
            insurance agreements, such as patient-pay agreements.

        class: A suite of underwriter specific classifiers.

        order: The order of applicability of this coverage relative to other coverages which
            are currently in force. Note, there may be gaps in the numbering and this does
            not imply primary, secondary etc. as the specific positioning of coverages
            depends upon the episode of care.

        network: The insurer-specific identifier for the insurer-defined network of providers
            to which the beneficiary may seek treatment which will be covered at the 'in-
            network' rate, otherwise 'out of network' terms and conditions apply.

        costToBeneficiary: A suite of codes indicating the cost category and associated amount which have
            been detailed in the policy and may have been  included on the health card.

        subrogation: When 'subrogation=true' this insurance instance has been included not for
            adjudication but to provide insurers with the details to recover costs.

        contract: The policy(s) which constitute this insurance coverage.
