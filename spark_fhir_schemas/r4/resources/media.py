        A photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare. The actual
        content may be inline or provided by direct reference.


        resourceType: This is a Media resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the
            image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids)
            and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers.

        basedOn: A procedure that is fulfilled in whole or in part by the creation of this
            media.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.

        status: The current state of the {{title}}.

        type: A code that classifies whether the media is an image, video or audio recording
            or some other media category.

        modality: Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of
            device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media
            resource, then this is the modality.

        view: The name of the imaging view e.g. Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP).

        subject: Who/What this Media is a record of.

        encounter: The encounter that establishes the context for this media.

        createdDateTime: The date and time(s) at which the media was collected.

        createdPeriod: The date and time(s) at which the media was collected.

        issued: The date and time this version of the media was made available to providers,
            typically after having been reviewed.

        operator: The person who administered the collection of the image.

        reasonCode: Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.

        bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e.
            the target site).

        deviceName: The name of the device / manufacturer of the device  that was used to make the
            recording.

        device: The device used to collect the media.

        height: Height of the image in pixels (photo/video).

        width: Width of the image in pixels (photo/video).

        frames: The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an
            imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or
            an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in
            order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget
            is required.

        duration: The duration of the recording in seconds - for audio and video.

        content: The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media
            source file.

        note: Comments made about the media by the performer, subject or other participants.
