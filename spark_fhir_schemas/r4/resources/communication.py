        resourceType: This is a Communication resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this communication by the performer or other
            systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from
            server to server.

        instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
            definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Communication.

        instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
            other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Communication.

        basedOn: An order, proposal or plan fulfilled in whole or in part by this
            Communication.

        partOf: Part of this action.

        inResponseTo: Prior communication that this communication is in response to.

        status: The status of the transmission.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the Communication.

        category: The type of message conveyed such as alert, notification, reminder,
            instruction, etc.

        priority: Characterizes how quickly the planned or in progress communication must be
            addressed. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.

        medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).

        subject: The patient or group that was the focus of this communication.

        topic: Description of the purpose/content, similar to a subject line in an email.

        about: Other resources that pertain to this communication and to which this
            communication should be associated.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this Communication was created or to which the
            creation of this record is tightly associated.

        sent: The time when this communication was sent.

        received: The time when this communication arrived at the destination.

        recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, care team
            or device) which was the target of the communication. If receipts need to be
            tracked by an individual, a separate resource instance will need to be created
            for each recipient.  Multiple recipient communications are intended where
            either receipts are not tracked (e.g. a mass mail-out) or a receipt is
            captured in aggregate (all emails confirmed received by a particular time).

        sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
            which was the source of the communication.

        reasonCode: The reason or justification for the communication.

        reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this communication.

        payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) that was communicated to the recipient.

        note: Additional notes or commentary about the communication by the sender, receiver
            or other interested parties.
