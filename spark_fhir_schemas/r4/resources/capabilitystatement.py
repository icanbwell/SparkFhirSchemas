        actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
        implementation.


        resourceType: This is a CapabilityStatement resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this capability statement when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this capability
            statement is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical
            reference. It SHALL remain the same when the capability statement is stored on
            different servers.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the capability
            statement when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
            This is an arbitrary value managed by the capability statement author and is
            not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
            yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation
            that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.

        name: A natural language name identifying the capability statement. This name should
            be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
            such as code generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the capability statement.

        status: The status of this capability statement. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
            the content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this capability statement is authored for
            testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
            used for genuine usage.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the capability statement was published.
            The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
            the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
            content of the capability statement changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the capability
            statement.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the capability statement from a
            consumer's perspective. Typically, this is used when the capability statement
            describes a desired rather than an actual solution, for example as a formal
            expression of requirements as part of an RFP.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate capability
            statement instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the capability statement is intended to
            be used.

        purpose: Explanation of why this capability statement is needed and why it has been
            designed as it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the capability statement and/or its
            contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the capability statement.

        kind: The way that this statement is intended to be used, to describe an actual
            running instance of software, a particular product (kind, not instance of
            software) or a class of implementation (e.g. a desired purchase).

        instantiates: Reference to a canonical URL of another CapabilityStatement that this software
            implements. This capability statement is a published API description that
            corresponds to a business service. The server may actually implement a subset
            of the capability statement it claims to implement, so the capability
            statement must specify the full capability details.

        imports: Reference to a canonical URL of another CapabilityStatement that this software
            adds to. The capability statement automatically includes everything in the
            other statement, and it is not duplicated, though the server may repeat the
            same resources, interactions and operations to add additional details to them.

        software: Software that is covered by this capability statement.  It is used when the
            capability statement describes the capabilities of a particular software
            version, independent of an installation.

        implementation: Identifies a specific implementation instance that is described by the
            capability statement - i.e. a particular installation, rather than the
            capabilities of a software program.

        fhirVersion: The version of the FHIR specification that this CapabilityStatement describes
            (which SHALL be the same as the FHIR version of the CapabilityStatement
            itself). There is no default value.

        format: A list of the formats supported by this implementation using their content
            types.

        patchFormat: A list of the patch formats supported by this implementation using their
            content types.

        implementationGuide: A list of implementation guides that the server does (or should) support in
            their entirety.

        rest: A definition of the restful capabilities of the solution, if any.

        messaging: A description of the messaging capabilities of the solution.

        document: A document definition.
