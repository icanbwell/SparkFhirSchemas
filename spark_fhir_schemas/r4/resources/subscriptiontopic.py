        resourceType: This is a SubscriptionTopic resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this subscription topic when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this subscription topic
            is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical
            reference. It SHALL remain the same when the subscription topic is stored on
            different servers.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this subscription topic by the performer
            and/or other systems.  These identifiers remain constant as the resource is
            updated and propagates from server to server.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the subscription topic
            when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
            an arbitrary value managed by the Topic author and is not expected to be
            globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
            managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
            are orderable.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the SubscriptionTopic, for
            example, "admission".

        derivedFrom: The canonical URL pointing to another FHIR-defined SubscriptionTopic that is
            adhered to in whole or in part by this SubscriptionTopic.

        status: The current state of the SubscriptionTopic.

        experimental: A flag to indicate that this TopSubscriptionTopicic is authored for testing
            purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and is not intended to be used
            for genuine usage.

        date: For draft definitions, indicates the date of initial creation.  For active
            definitions, represents the date of activation.  For withdrawn definitions,
            indicates the date of withdrawal.

        publisher: Helps establish the "authority/credibility" of the SubscriptionTopic.  May
            also allow for contact.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the Topic from the consumer's
            perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching
            of code system definitions.

        jurisdiction: A jurisdiction in which the Topic is intended to be used.

        purpose: Explains why this Topic is needed and why it has been designed as it has.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the SubscriptionTopic and/or its contents.
            Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
            publishing of the SubscriptionTopic.

        approvalDate: The date on which the asset content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the asset content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after that, but doesn't change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the SubscriptionTopic content was or is planned to be
            effective.

        resourceTrigger: A definition of a resource-based event that triggers a notification based on
            the SubscriptionTopic. The criteria may be just a human readable description
            and/or a full FHIR search string or FHIRPath expression. Multiple triggers are
            considered OR joined (e.g., a resource update matching ANY of the definitions
            will trigger a notification).

        eventTrigger: Event definition which can be used to trigger the SubscriptionTopic.

        canFilterBy: List of properties by which Subscriptions on the SubscriptionTopic can be
            filtered. May be defined Search Parameters (e.g., Encounter.patient) or
            parameters defined within this SubscriptionTopic context (e.g., hub.event).

        notificationShape: List of properties to describe the shape (e.g., resources) included in
            notifications from this Subscription Topic.
