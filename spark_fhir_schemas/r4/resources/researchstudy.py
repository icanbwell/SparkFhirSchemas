        resourceType: This is a ResearchStudy resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifiers assigned to this research study by the sponsor or other systems.

        title: A short, descriptive user-friendly label for the study.

        protocol: The set of steps expected to be performed as part of the execution of the
            study.

        partOf: A larger research study of which this particular study is a component or step.

        status: The current state of the study.

        primaryPurposeType: The type of study based upon the intent of the study's activities. A
            classification of the intent of the study.

        phase: The stage in the progression of a therapy from initial experimental use in
            humans in clinical trials to post-market evaluation.

        category: Codes categorizing the type of study such as investigational vs.
            observational, type of blinding, type of randomization, safety vs. efficacy,
            etc.

        focus: The medication(s), food(s), therapy(ies), device(s) or other concerns or
            interventions that the study is seeking to gain more information about.

        condition: The condition that is the focus of the study.  For example, In a study to
            examine risk factors for Lupus, might have as an inclusion criterion "healthy
            volunteer", but the target condition code would be a Lupus SNOMED code.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in learning more about or engaging with the
            study.

        relatedArtifact: Citations, references and other related documents.

        keyword: Key terms to aid in searching for or filtering the study.

        location: Indicates a country, state or other region where the study is taking place.

        description: A full description of how the study is being conducted.

        enrollment: Reference to a Group that defines the criteria for and quantity of subjects
            participating in the study.  E.g. " 200 female Europeans between the ages of
            20 and 45 with early onset diabetes".

        period: Identifies the start date and the expected (or actual, depending on status)
            end date for the study.

        sponsor: An organization that initiates the investigation and is legally responsible
            for the study.

        principalInvestigator: A researcher in a study who oversees multiple aspects of the study, such as
            concept development, protocol writing, protocol submission for IRB approval,
            participant recruitment, informed consent, data collection, analysis,
            interpretation and presentation.

        site: A facility in which study activities are conducted.

        reasonStopped: A description and/or code explaining the premature termination of the study.

        note: Comments made about the study by the performer, subject or other participants.

        arm: Describes an expected sequence of events for one of the participants of a
            study.  E.g. Exposure to drug A, wash-out, exposure to drug B, wash-out,
            follow-up.

        objective: A goal that the study is aiming to achieve in terms of a scientific question
            to be answered by the analysis of data collected during the study.
