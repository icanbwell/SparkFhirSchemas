        Raw data describing a biological sequence.


        resourceType: This is a MolecularSequence resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: A unique identifier for this particular sequence instance. This is a FHIR-
            defined id.

        type: Amino Acid Sequence/ DNA Sequence / RNA Sequence.

        coordinateSystem: Whether the sequence is numbered starting at 0 (0-based numbering or
            coordinates, inclusive start, exclusive end) or starting at 1 (1-based
            numbering, inclusive start and inclusive end).

        patient: The patient whose sequencing results are described by this resource.

        specimen: Specimen used for sequencing.

        device: The method for sequencing, for example, chip information.

        performer: The organization or lab that should be responsible for this result.

        quantity: The number of copies of the sequence of interest. (RNASeq).

        referenceSeq: A sequence that is used as a reference to describe variants that are present
            in a sequence analyzed.

        variant: The definition of variant here originates from Sequence ontology ([variant_of]
            (http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/variant_of)). This
            element can represent amino acid or nucleic sequence change(including
            insertion,deletion,SNP,etc.)  It can represent some complex mutation or
            segment variation with the assist of CIGAR string.

        observedSeq: Sequence that was observed. It is the result marked by referenceSeq along with
            variant records on referenceSeq. This shall start from
            referenceSeq.windowStart and end by referenceSeq.windowEnd.

        quality: An experimental feature attribute that defines the quality of the feature in a
            quantitative way, such as a phred quality score ([SO:0001686](http://www.seque
            nceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001686)).

        readCoverage: Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing a
            given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence.

        repository: Configurations of the external repository. The repository shall store target's
            observedSeq or records related with target's observedSeq.

        pointer: Pointer to next atomic sequence which at most contains one variant.

        structureVariant: Information about chromosome structure variation.
