        resourceType: This is a CommunicationRequest resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this communication request by the performer
            or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and
            propagates from server to server.

        basedOn: A plan or proposal that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this request.

        replaces: Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new
            request.

        groupIdentifier: A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less
            simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the
            requisition, prescription or similar form.

        status: The status of the proposal or order.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the CommunicationRequest.

        category: The type of message to be sent such as alert, notification, reminder,
            instruction, etc.

        priority: Characterizes how quickly the proposed act must be initiated. Includes
            concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.

        doNotPerform: If true indicates that the CommunicationRequest is asking for the specified
            action to *not* occur.

        medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).

        subject: The patient or group that is the focus of this communication request.

        about: Other resources that pertain to this communication request and to which this
            communication request should be associated.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this CommunicationRequest was created or to which
            the creation of this record is tightly associated.

        payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) to be communicated to the recipient.

        occurrenceDateTime: The time when this communication is to occur.

        occurrencePeriod: The time when this communication is to occur.

        authoredOn: For draft requests, indicates the date of initial creation.  For requests with
            other statuses, indicates the date of activation.

        requester: The device, individual, or organization who initiated the request and has
            responsibility for its activation.

        recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, device,
            group, or care team) which is the intended target of the communication.

        sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
            which is to be the source of the communication.

        reasonCode: Describes why the request is being made in coded or textual form.

        reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this request.

        note: Comments made about the request by the requester, sender, recipient, subject
            or other participants.
