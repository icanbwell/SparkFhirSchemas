        resourceType: This is a AppointmentResponse resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: This records identifiers associated with this appointment response concern
            that are defined by business processes and/ or used to refer to it when a
            direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate.

        appointment: Appointment that this response is replying to.

        start: Date/Time that the appointment is to take place, or requested new start time.

        end: This may be either the same as the appointment request to confirm the details
            of the appointment, or alternately a new time to request a re-negotiation of
            the end time.

        participantType: Role of participant in the appointment.

        actor: A Person, Location, HealthcareService, or Device that is participating in the
            appointment.

        participantStatus: Participation status of the participant. When the status is declined or
            tentative if the start/end times are different to the appointment, then these
            times should be interpreted as a requested time change. When the status is
            accepted, the times can either be the time of the appointment (as a
            confirmation of the time) or can be empty.

        comment: Additional comments about the appointment.
