        resourceType: This is a MedicationAdministration resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: Identifiers associated with this Medication Administration that are defined by
            business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
            the resource itself is not appropriate. They are business identifiers assigned
            to this resource by the performer or other systems and remain constant as the
            resource is updated and propagates from server to server.

        instantiates: A protocol, guideline, orderset, or other definition that was adhered to in
            whole or in part by this event.

        partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.

        status: Will generally be set to show that the administration has been completed.  For
            some long running administrations such as infusions, it is possible for an
            administration to be started but not completed or it may be paused while some
            other process is under way.

        statusReason: A code indicating why the administration was not performed.

        category: Indicates where the medication is expected to be consumed or administered.

        medicationCodeableConcept: Identifies the medication that was administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        medicationReference: Identifies the medication that was administered. This is either a link to a
            resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute
            carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of
            medications.

        subject: The person or animal or group receiving the medication.

        context: The visit, admission, or other contact between patient and health care
            provider during which the medication administration was performed.

        supportingInformation: Additional information (for example, patient height and weight) that supports
            the administration of the medication.

        effectiveDateTime: A specific date/time or interval of time during which the administration took
            place (or did not take place, when the 'notGiven' attribute is true). For many
            administrations, such as swallowing a tablet the use of dateTime is more
            appropriate.

        effectivePeriod: A specific date/time or interval of time during which the administration took
            place (or did not take place, when the 'notGiven' attribute is true). For many
            administrations, such as swallowing a tablet the use of dateTime is more
            appropriate.

        performer: Indicates who or what performed the medication administration and how they
            were involved.

        reasonCode: A code indicating why the medication was given.

        reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication was administered.

        request: The original request, instruction or authority to perform the administration.

        device: The device used in administering the medication to the patient.  For example,
            a particular infusion pump.

        note: Extra information about the medication administration that is not conveyed by
            the other attributes.

        dosage: Describes the medication dosage information details e.g. dose, rate, site,
            route, etc.

        eventHistory: A summary of the events of interest that have occurred, such as when the
            administration was verified.
