        such as logic libraries and information model descriptions, as well as to
        describe a collection of knowledge assets.


        resourceType: This is a Library resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this library when it is referenced in
            a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical
            identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at
            which at which an authoritative instance of this library is (or will be)
            published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL
            remain the same when the library is stored on different servers.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this library when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance. e.g. CMS or NQF identifiers for a measure artifact. Note that
            at least one identifier is required for non-experimental active artifacts.

        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the library when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary
            value managed by the library author and is not expected to be globally unique.
            For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is
            not available. There is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a
            lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the Decision
            Support Service specification, use the format Major.Minor.Revision (e.g.
            1.0.0). For more information on versioning knowledge assets, refer to the
            Decision Support Service specification. Note that a version is required for
            non-experimental active artifacts.

        name: A natural language name identifying the library. This name should be usable as
            an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as code
            generation.

        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the library.

        subtitle: An explanatory or alternate title for the library giving additional
            information about its content.

        status: The status of this library. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.

        experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this library is authored for testing purposes
            (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used for genuine
            usage.

        type: Identifies the type of library such as a Logic Library, Model Definition,
            Asset Collection, or Module Definition.

        subjectCodeableConcept: A code or group definition that describes the intended subject of the contents
            of the library.

        subjectReference: A code or group definition that describes the intended subject of the contents
            of the library.

        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the library was published. The date must
            change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code
            changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the
            library changes.

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the library.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        description: A free text natural language description of the library from a consumer's
            perspective.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate library
            instances.

        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the library is intended to be used.

        purpose: Explanation of why this library is needed and why it has been designed as it
            has.

        usage: A detailed description of how the library is used from a clinical perspective.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the library and/or its contents. Copyright
            statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and publishing of the
            library.

        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
            happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.

        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
            periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.

        effectivePeriod: The period during which the library content was or is planned to be in active
            use.

        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the library. Topics provide a
            high-level categorization of the library that can be useful for filtering and
            searching.

        author: An individiual or organization primarily involved in the creation and
            maintenance of the content.

        editor: An individual or organization primarily responsible for internal coherence of
            the content.

        reviewer: An individual or organization primarily responsible for review of some aspect
            of the content.

        endorser: An individual or organization responsible for officially endorsing the content
            for use in some setting.

        relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
            bibliographic references.

        parameter: The parameter element defines parameters used by the library.

        dataRequirement: Describes a set of data that must be provided in order to be able to
            successfully perform the computations defined by the library.

        content: The content of the library as an Attachment. The content may be a reference to
            a url, or may be directly embedded as a base-64 string. Either way, the
            contentType of the attachment determines how to interpret the content.
