        A summary of information based on the results of executing a TestScript.


        resourceType: This is a TestReport resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Identifier for the TestScript assigned for external purposes outside the
            context of FHIR.

        name: A free text natural language name identifying the executed TestScript.

        status: The current state of this test report.

        testScript: Ideally this is an absolute URL that is used to identify the version-specific
            TestScript that was executed, matching the `TestScript.url`.

        result: The overall result from the execution of the TestScript.

        score: The final score (percentage of tests passed) resulting from the execution of
            the TestScript.

        tester: Name of the tester producing this report (Organization or individual).

        issued: When the TestScript was executed and this TestReport was generated.

        participant: A participant in the test execution, either the execution engine, a client, or
            a server.

        setup: The results of the series of required setup operations before the tests were
            executed.

        test: A test executed from the test script.

        teardown: The results of the series of operations required to clean up after all the
            tests were executed (successfully or otherwise).
