        "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
        such as Apgar score.


        resourceType: This is a ClinicalImpression resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this clinical impression by the performer or
            other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates
            from server to server.

        status: Identifies the workflow status of the assessment.

        statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the ClinicalImpression.

        code: Categorizes the type of clinical assessment performed.

        description: A summary of the context and/or cause of the assessment - why / where it was
            performed, and what patient events/status prompted it.

        subject: The patient or group of individuals assessed as part of this record.

        encounter: The Encounter during which this ClinicalImpression was created or to which the
            creation of this record is tightly associated.

        effectiveDateTime: The point in time or period over which the subject was assessed.

        effectivePeriod: The point in time or period over which the subject was assessed.

        date: Indicates when the documentation of the assessment was complete.

        assessor: The clinician performing the assessment.

        previous: A reference to the last assessment that was conducted on this patient.
            Assessments are often/usually ongoing in nature; a care provider (practitioner
            or team) will make new assessments on an ongoing basis as new data arises or
            the patient's conditions changes.

        problem: A list of the relevant problems/conditions for a patient.

        investigation: One or more sets of investigations (signs, symptoms, etc.). The actual
            grouping of investigations varies greatly depending on the type and context of
            the assessment. These investigations may include data generated during the
            assessment process, or data previously generated and recorded that is
            pertinent to the outcomes.

        protocol: Reference to a specific published clinical protocol that was followed during
            this assessment, and/or that provides evidence in support of the diagnosis.

        summary: A text summary of the investigations and the diagnosis.

        finding: Specific findings or diagnoses that were considered likely or relevant to
            ongoing treatment.

        prognosisCodeableConcept: Estimate of likely outcome.

        prognosisReference: RiskAssessment expressing likely outcome.

        supportingInfo: Information supporting the clinical impression.

        note: Commentary about the impression, typically recorded after the impression
            itself was made, though supplemental notes by the original author could also
            appear.
