        fraction: This element is capturing information about the fraction of a plant part, or
            human plasma for fractionation.

        materialType: The specific type of the material constituting the component. For Herbal
            preparations the particulars of the extracts (liquid/dry) is described in
            Specified Substance Group 1.
