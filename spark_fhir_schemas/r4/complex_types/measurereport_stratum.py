        value: The value for this stratum, expressed as a CodeableConcept. When defining
            stratifiers on complex values, the value must be rendered such that the value

        component: A stratifier component value.

        population: The populations that make up the stratum, one for each type of population
            appropriate to the measure.

        measureScore: The measure score for this stratum, calculated as appropriate for the measure
            type and scoring method, and based on only the members of this stratum.
