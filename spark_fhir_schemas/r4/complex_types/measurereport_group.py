        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        code: The meaning of the population group as defined in the measure definition.

        population: The populations that make up the population group, one for each type of
            population appropriate for the measure.

        measureScore: The measure score for this population group, calculated as appropriate for the
            measure type and scoring method, and based on the contents of the populations
            defined in the group.

        stratifier: When a measure includes multiple stratifiers, there will be a stratifier group
            for each stratifier defined by the measure.
