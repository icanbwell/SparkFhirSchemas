        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        contentType: Identifies the type of the data in the attachment and allows a method to be
            chosen to interpret or render the data. Includes mime type parameters such as
            charset where appropriate.

        language: The human language of the content. The value can be any valid value according
            to BCP 47.

        data: The actual data of the attachment - a sequence of bytes, base64 encoded.

        url: A location where the data can be accessed.

        size: The number of bytes of data that make up this attachment (before base64
            encoding, if that is done).

        hash: The calculated hash of the data using SHA-1. Represented using base64.

        title: A label or set of text to display in place of the data.

        creation: The date that the attachment was first created.
