        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        question: The linkId for the question whose answer (or lack of answer) governs whether
            this item is enabled.

        operator: Specifies the criteria by which the question is enabled.

        answerBoolean: A value that the referenced question is tested using the specified operator in
            order for the item to be enabled.

        answerDecimal: A value that the referenced question is tested using the specified operator in
            order for the item to be enabled.
