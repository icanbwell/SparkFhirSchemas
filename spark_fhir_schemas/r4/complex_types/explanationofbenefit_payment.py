        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        type: Whether this represents partial or complete payment of the benefits payable.

        adjustment: Total amount of all adjustments to this payment included in this transaction
            which are not related to this claim's adjudication.

        adjustmentReason: Reason for the payment adjustment.

        date: Estimated date the payment will be issued or the actual issue date of payment.

        amount: Benefits payable less any payment adjustment.

        identifier: Issuer's unique identifier for the payment instrument.
