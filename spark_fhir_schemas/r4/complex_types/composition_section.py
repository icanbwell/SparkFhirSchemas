        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        title: The label for this particular section.  This will be part of the rendered
            content for the document, and is often used to build a table of contents.

        code: A code identifying the kind of content contained within the section. This must
            be consistent with the section title.

        author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in this section, not
            necessarily who typed it in.

        focus: The actual focus of the section when it is not the subject of the composition,
            but instead represents something or someone associated with the subject such
            as (for a patient subject) a spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. If not focus is
            specified, the focus is assumed to be focus of the parent section, or, for a
            section in the Composition itself, the subject of the composition. Sections
            with a focus SHALL only include resources where the logical subject (patient,
            subject, focus, etc.) matches the section focus, or the resources have no
            logical subject (few resources).

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains the attested content of the section,
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.

        mode: How the entry list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is
            suitable for being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a
            snapshot of a list of items from another source, or whether it is a prepared
            list where items may be marked as added, modified or deleted.

        orderedBy: Specifies the order applied to the items in the section entries.

        entry: A reference to the actual resource from which the narrative in the section is
            derived.

        emptyReason: If the section is empty, why the list is empty. An empty section typically has
            some text explaining the empty reason.

        section: A nested sub-section within this section.
