        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        title: The label for this particular section.  This will be part of the rendered
            content for the document, and is often used to build a table of contents.

        code: A code identifying the kind of content contained within the section. This must
            be consistent with the section title.

        author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in this section, not
            necessarily who typed it in.

        focus: The actual focus of the section when it is not the subject of the composition,
            but instead represents something or someone associated with the subject such
            as (for a patient subject) a spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. If not focus is
            specified, the focus is assumed to be focus of the parent section, or, for a
            section in the Composition itself, the subject of the composition. Sections
            with a focus SHALL only include resources where the logical subject (patient,
            subject, focus, etc.) matches the section focus, or the resources have no
            logical subject (few resources).

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains the attested content of the section,
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.

        mode: How the entry list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is
            suitable for being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a
            snapshot of a list of items from another source, or whether it is a prepared
            list where items may be marked as added, modified or deleted.

        orderedBy: Specifies the order applied to the items in the section entries.

        entry: A reference to the actual resource from which the narrative in the section is
            derived.

        emptyReason: If the section is empty, why the list is empty. An empty section typically has
            some text explaining the empty reason.

        section: A nested sub-section within this section.
