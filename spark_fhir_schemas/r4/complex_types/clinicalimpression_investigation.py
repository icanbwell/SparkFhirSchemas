        A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may
        affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies
        that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with
        a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the
        clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
        "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
        such as Apgar score.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        code: A name/code for the group ("set") of investigations. Typically, this will be
            something like "signs", "symptoms", "clinical", "diagnostic", but the list is
            not constrained, and others such groups such as
            (exposure|family|travel|nutritional) history may be used.

        item: A record of a specific investigation that was undertaken.
