            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        modifier: The nutrient that is being modified such as carbohydrate or sodium.

        amount: The quantity of the specified nutrient to include in diet.
