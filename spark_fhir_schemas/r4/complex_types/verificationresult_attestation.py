        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        who: The individual or organization attesting to information.

        onBehalfOf: When the who is asserting on behalf of another (organization or individual).

        communicationMethod: The method by which attested information was submitted/retrieved (manual; API;
            Push).

        date: The date the information was attested to.

        sourceIdentityCertificate: A digital identity certificate associated with the attestation source.

        proxyIdentityCertificate: A digital identity certificate associated with the proxy entity submitting
            attested information on behalf of the attestation source.

        proxySignature: Signed assertion by the proxy entity indicating that they have the right to
            submit attested information on behalf of the attestation source.

        sourceSignature: Signed assertion by the attestation source that they have attested to the
            information.
