        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        who: Reference to the primary source.

        type: Type of primary source (License Board; Primary Education; Continuing
            Education; Postal Service; Relationship owner; Registration Authority; legal
            source; issuing source; authoritative source).

        communicationMethod: Method for communicating with the primary source (manual; API; Push).

        validationStatus: Status of the validation of the target against the primary source (successful;
            failed; unknown).

        validationDate: When the target was validated against the primary source.

        canPushUpdates: Ability of the primary source to push updates/alerts (yes; no; undetermined).

        pushTypeAvailable: Type of alerts/updates the primary source can send (specific requested
            changes; any changes; as defined by source).
