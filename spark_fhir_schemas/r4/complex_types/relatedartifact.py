        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        type: The type of relationship to the related artifact.

        label: A short label that can be used to reference the citation from elsewhere in the
            containing artifact, such as a footnote index.

        display: A brief description of the document or knowledge resource being referenced,
            suitable for display to a consumer.

        citation: A bibliographic citation for the related artifact. This text SHOULD be
            formatted according to an accepted citation format.

        url: A url for the artifact that can be followed to access the actual content.

        document: The document being referenced, represented as an attachment. This is exclusive
            with the resource element.

        resource: The related resource, such as a library, value set, profile, or other
            knowledge resource.
