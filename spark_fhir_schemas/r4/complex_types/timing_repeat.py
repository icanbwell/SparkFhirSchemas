        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        boundsDuration: Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of possible
            length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing schedule.

        boundsRange: Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of possible
            length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing schedule.

        boundsPeriod: Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of possible
            length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing schedule.

        count: A total count of the desired number of repetitions across the duration of the
            entire timing specification. If countMax is present, this element indicates
            the lower bound of the allowed range of count values.

        countMax: If present, indicates that the count is a range - so to perform the action
            between [count] and [countMax] times.

        duration: How long this thing happens for when it happens. If durationMax is present,
            this element indicates the lower bound of the allowed range of the duration.

        durationMax: If present, indicates that the duration is a range - so to perform the action
            between [duration] and [durationMax] time length.

        durationUnit: The units of time for the duration, in UCUM units.

        frequency: The number of times to repeat the action within the specified period. If
            frequencyMax is present, this element indicates the lower bound of the allowed
            range of the frequency.

        frequencyMax: If present, indicates that the frequency is a range - so to repeat between
            [frequency] and [frequencyMax] times within the period or period range.

        period: Indicates the duration of time over which repetitions are to occur; e.g. to
            express "3 times per day", 3 would be the frequency and "1 day" would be the
            period. If periodMax is present, this element indicates the lower bound of the
            allowed range of the period length.

        periodMax: If present, indicates that the period is a range from [period] to [periodMax],
            allowing expressing concepts such as "do this once every 3-5 days.

        periodUnit: The units of time for the period in UCUM units.

        dayOfWeek: If one or more days of week is provided, then the action happens only on the
            specified day(s).

        timeOfDay: Specified time of day for action to take place.

        when: An approximate time period during the day, potentially linked to an event of
            daily living that indicates when the action should occur.

        offset: The number of minutes from the event. If the event code does not indicate
            whether the minutes is before or after the event, then the offset is assumed
            to be after the event.
