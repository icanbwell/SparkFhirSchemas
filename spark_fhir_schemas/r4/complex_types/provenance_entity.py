        Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
        involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource.
        Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling
        trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of
        contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
        provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of
        confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and
        stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally
        authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        role: How the entity was used during the activity.

        what: Identity of the  Entity used. May be a logical or physical uri and maybe
            absolute or relative.

        agent: The entity is attributed to an agent to express the agent's responsibility for
            that entity, possibly along with other agents. This description can be
            understood as shorthand for saying that the agent was responsible for the
            activity which generated the entity.
