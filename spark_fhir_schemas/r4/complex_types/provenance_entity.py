        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        role: How the entity was used during the activity.

        what: Identity of the  Entity used. May be a logical or physical uri and maybe
            absolute or relative.

        agent: The entity is attributed to an agent to express the agent's responsibility for
            that entity, possibly along with other agents. This description can be
            understood as shorthand for saying that the agent was responsible for the
