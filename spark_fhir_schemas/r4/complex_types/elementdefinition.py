        Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or
        extension.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        path: The path identifies the element and is expressed as a "."-separated list of
            ancestor elements, beginning with the name of the resource or extension.

        representation: Codes that define how this element is represented in instances, when the
            deviation varies from the normal case.

        sliceName: The name of this element definition slice, when slicing is working. The name
            must be a token with no dots or spaces. This is a unique name referring to a
            specific set of constraints applied to this element, used to provide a name to
            different slices of the same element.

        sliceIsConstraining: If true, indicates that this slice definition is constraining a slice
            definition with the same name in an inherited profile. If false, the slice is
            not overriding any slice in an inherited profile. If missing, the slice might
            or might not be overriding a slice in an inherited profile, depending on the
            sliceName.

        label: A single preferred label which is the text to display beside the element
            indicating its meaning or to use to prompt for the element in a user display
            or form.

        code: A code that has the same meaning as the element in a particular terminology.

        slicing: Indicates that the element is sliced into a set of alternative definitions
            (i.e. in a structure definition, there are multiple different constraints on a
            single element in the base resource). Slicing can be used in any resource that
            has cardinality ..* on the base resource, or any resource with a choice of
            types. The set of slices is any elements that come after this in the element
            sequence that have the same path, until a shorter path occurs (the shorter
            path terminates the set).

        short: A concise description of what this element means (e.g. for use in
            autogenerated summaries).

        definition: Provides a complete explanation of the meaning of the data element for human
            readability.  For the case of elements derived from existing elements (e.g.
            constraints), the definition SHALL be consistent with the base definition, but
            convey the meaning of the element in the particular context of use of the
            resource. (Note: The text you are reading is specified in
            ElementDefinition.definition).

        comment: Explanatory notes and implementation guidance about the data element,
            including notes about how to use the data properly, exceptions to proper use,
            etc. (Note: The text you are reading is specified in
            ElementDefinition.comment).

        requirements: This element is for traceability of why the element was created and why the
            constraints exist as they do. This may be used to point to source materials or
            specifications that drove the structure of this element.

        alias: Identifies additional names by which this element might also be known.

        min: The minimum number of times this element SHALL appear in the instance.

        max: The maximum number of times this element is permitted to appear in the
            instance.

        base: Information about the base definition of the element, provided to make it
            unnecessary for tools to trace the deviation of the element through the
            derived and related profiles. When the element definition is not the original
            definition of an element - i.g. either in a constraint on another type, or for
            elements from a super type in a snap shot - then the information in provided
            in the element definition may be different to the base definition. On the
            original definition of the element, it will be same.

        contentReference: Identifies an element defined elsewhere in the definition whose content rules
            should be applied to the current element. ContentReferences bring across all
            the rules that are in the ElementDefinition for the element, including
            definitions, cardinality constraints, bindings, invariants etc.

        type: The data type or resource that the value of this element is permitted to be.

        example: A sample value for this element demonstrating the type of information that

        condition: A reference to an invariant that may make additional statements about the
            cardinality or value in the instance.

        constraint: Formal constraints such as co-occurrence and other constraints that can be
            computationally evaluated within the context of the instance.

        mustSupport: If true, implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL provide
            "support" for the element in some meaningful way.  If false, the element may
            be ignored and not supported. If false, whether to populate or use the data
            element in any way is at the discretion of the implementation.

        isModifier: If true, the value of this element affects the interpretation of the element
            or resource that contains it, and the value of the element cannot be ignored.
            Typically, this is used for status, negation and qualification codes. The
            effect of this is that the element cannot be ignored by systems: they SHALL
            either recognize the element and process it, and/or a pre-determination has
            been made that it is not relevant to their particular system.

        isModifierReason: Explains how that element affects the interpretation of the resource or
            element that contains it.

        isSummary: Whether the element should be included if a client requests a search with the
            parameter _summary=true.

        binding: Binds to a value set if this element is coded (code, Coding, CodeableConcept,
            Quantity), or the data types (string, uri).

        mapping: Identifies a concept from an external specification that roughly corresponds
            to this element.
