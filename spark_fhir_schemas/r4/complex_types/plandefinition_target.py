        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        measure: The parameter whose value is to be tracked, e.g. body weight, blood pressure,
            or hemoglobin A1c level.

        detailQuantity: The target value of the measure to be achieved to signify fulfillment of the
            goal, e.g. 150 pounds or 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values of the
            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the
            goal is achieved at any value at or below the high value. Similarly, if the
            high value is missing, it indicates that the goal is achieved at any value at
            or above the low value.

        detailRange: The target value of the measure to be achieved to signify fulfillment of the
            goal, e.g. 150 pounds or 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values of the
            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the
