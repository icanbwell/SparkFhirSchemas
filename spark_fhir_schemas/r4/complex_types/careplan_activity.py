        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        outcomeCodeableConcept: Identifies the outcome at the point when the status of the activity is
            assessed.  For example, the outcome of an education activity could be patient
            understands (or not).

        outcomeReference: Details of the outcome or action resulting from the activity.  The reference
            to an "event" resource, such as Procedure or Encounter or Observation, is the
            result/outcome of the activity itself.  The activity can be conveyed using
            CarePlan.activity.detail OR using the CarePlan.activity.reference (a reference
            to a “request” resource).

        progress: Notes about the adherence/status/progress of the activity.

        reference: The details of the proposed activity represented in a specific resource.

        detail: A simple summary of a planned activity suitable for a general care plan system
            (e.g. form driven) that doesn't know about specific resources such as
            procedure etc.
