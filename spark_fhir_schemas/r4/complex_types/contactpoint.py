        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        system: Telecommunications form for contact point - what communications system is
            required to make use of the contact.

        value: The actual contact point details, in a form that is meaningful to the
            designated communication system (i.e. phone number or email address).

        use: Identifies the purpose for the contact point.

        rank: Specifies a preferred order in which to use a set of contacts. ContactPoints
            with lower rank values are more preferred than those with higher rank values.

        period: Time period when the contact point was/is in use.
