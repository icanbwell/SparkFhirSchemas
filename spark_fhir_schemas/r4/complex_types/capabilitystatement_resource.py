        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        type: A type of resource exposed via the restful interface.

        profile: A specification of the profile that describes the solution's overall support
            for the resource, including any constraints on cardinality, bindings, lengths
            or other limitations. See further discussion in [Using
            Profiles](profiling.html#profile-uses).

        supportedProfile: A list of profiles that represent different use cases supported by the system.
            For a server, "supported by the system" means the system hosts/produces a set
            of resources that are conformant to a particular profile, and allows clients
            that use its services to search using this profile and to find appropriate
            data. For a client, it means the system will search by this profile and
            process data according to the guidance implicit in the profile. See further
            discussion in [Using Profiles](profiling.html#profile-uses).

        documentation: Additional information about the resource type used by the system.

        interaction: Identifies a restful operation supported by the solution.

        versioning: This field is set to no-version to specify that the system does not support
            (server) or use (client) versioning for this resource type. If this has some
            other value, the server must at least correctly track and populate the
            versionId meta-property on resources. If the value is 'versioned-update', then
            the server supports all the versioning features, including using e-tags for
            version integrity in the API.

        readHistory: A flag for whether the server is able to return past versions as part of the
            vRead operation.

        updateCreate: A flag to indicate that the server allows or needs to allow the client to
            create new identities on the server (that is, the client PUTs to a location
            where there is no existing resource). Allowing this operation means that the
            server allows the client to create new identities on the server.

        conditionalCreate: A flag that indicates that the server supports conditional create.

        conditionalRead: A code that indicates how the server supports conditional read.

        conditionalUpdate: A flag that indicates that the server supports conditional update.

        conditionalDelete: A code that indicates how the server supports conditional delete.

        referencePolicy: A set of flags that defines how references are supported.

        searchInclude: A list of _include values supported by the server.

        searchRevInclude: A list of _revinclude (reverse include) values supported by the server.

        searchParam: Search parameters for implementations to support and/or make use of - either
            references to ones defined in the specification, or additional ones defined
            for/by the implementation.

        operation: Definition of an operation or a named query together with its parameters and
            their meaning and type. Consult the definition of the operation for details
            about how to invoke the operation, and the parameters.
