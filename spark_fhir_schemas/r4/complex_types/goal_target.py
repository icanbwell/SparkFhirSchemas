        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        measure: The parameter whose value is being tracked, e.g. body weight, blood pressure,
            or hemoglobin A1c level.

        detailQuantity: The target value of the focus to be achieved to signify the fulfillment of the
            goal, e.g. 150 pounds, 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values of the
            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the
            goal is achieved at any focus value at or below the high value. Similarly, if
            the high value is missing, it indicates that the goal is achieved at any focus
            value at or above the low value.

        detailRange: The target value of the focus to be achieved to signify the fulfillment of the
            goal, e.g. 150 pounds, 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values of the
            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the

            value at or above the low value.

        detailCodeableConcept: The target value of the focus to be achieved to signify the fulfillment of the
            goal, e.g. 150 pounds, 7.0%. Either the high or low or both values of the
            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the

        detailString: The target value of the focus to be achieved to signify the fulfillment of the

            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the

            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the

            range can be specified. When a low value is missing, it indicates that the

            value at or above the low value.

        dueDate: Indicates either the date or the duration after start by which the goal should
            be met.

        dueDuration: Indicates either the date or the duration after start by which the goal should
            be met.
