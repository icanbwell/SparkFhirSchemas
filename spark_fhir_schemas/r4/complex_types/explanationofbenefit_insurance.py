        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        focal: A flag to indicate that this Coverage is to be used for adjudication of this
            claim when set to true.

        coverage: Reference to the insurance card level information contained in the Coverage
            resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the
            patient's actual coverage within the insurer's information system.

        preAuthRef: Reference numbers previously provided by the insurer to the provider to be
            quoted on subsequent claims containing services or products related to the
            prior authorization.
