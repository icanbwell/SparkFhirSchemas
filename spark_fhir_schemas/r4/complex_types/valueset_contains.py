        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        system: An absolute URI which is the code system in which the code for this item in
            the expansion is defined.

        abstract: If true, this entry is included in the expansion for navigational purposes,
            and the user cannot select the code directly as a proper value.

        inactive: If the concept is inactive in the code system that defines it. Inactive codes
            are those that are no longer to be used, but are maintained by the code system
            for understanding legacy data. It might not be known or specified whether an
            concept is inactive (and it may depend on the context of use).

        version: The version of the code system from this code was taken. Note that a well-
            maintained code system does not need the version reported, because the meaning
            of codes is consistent across versions. However this cannot consistently be
            assured, and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be consistent, the version
            SHOULD be exchanged.

        code: The code for this item in the expansion hierarchy. If this code is missing the
            entry in the hierarchy is a place holder (abstract) and does not represent a
            valid code in the value set.

        display: The recommended display for this item in the expansion.

        designation: Additional representations for this item - other languages, aliases,
            specialized purposes, used for particular purposes, etc. These are relevant
            when the conditions of the expansion do not fix to a single correct
            representation.
