        identifier: Including possibly Data Carrier Identifier.

        type: The physical type of the container of the medicine.

        quantity: The quantity of this package in the medicinal product, at the current level of

        material: Material type of the package item.

        alternateMaterial: A possible alternate material for the packaging.

        device: A device accompanying a medicinal product.

        manufacturedItem: The manufactured item as contained in the packaged medicinal product.

        packageItem: Allows containers within containers.

        physicalCharacteristics: Dimensions, color etc.

        otherCharacteristics: Other codeable characteristics.

        shelfLifeStorage: Shelf Life and storage information.

        manufacturer: Manufacturer of this Package Item.
