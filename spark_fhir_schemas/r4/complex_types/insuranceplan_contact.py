        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        purpose: Indicates a purpose for which the contact can be reached.

        name: A name associated with the contact.

        telecom: A contact detail (e.g. a telephone number or an email address) by which the
            party may be contacted.

        address: Visiting or postal addresses for the contact.
