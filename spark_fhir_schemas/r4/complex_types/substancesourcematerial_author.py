        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        authorType: The type of author of an organism species shall be specified. The
            parenthetical author of an organism species refers to the first author who
            published the plant/animal name (of any rank). The primary author of an
            organism species refers to the first author(s), who validly published the
            plant/animal name.

            organism shall also be specified when applicable; refers to the year in which
