        isDerived: Primary of secondary specimen.

        type: The kind of specimen conditioned for testing expected by lab.

        preference: The preference for this type of conditioned specimen.

        container: The specimen's container.

        requirement: Requirements for delivery and special handling of this kind of conditioned
            specimen.

        retentionTime: The usual time that a specimen of this kind is retained after the ordered
            tests are completed, for the purpose of additional testing.

        rejectionCriterion: Criterion for rejection of the specimen in its container by the laboratory.

        handling: Set of instructions for preservation/transport of the specimen at a defined
            temperature interval, prior the testing process.
