        Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or

        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        key: Allows identification of which elements have their cardinalities impacted by
            the constraint.  Will not be referenced for constraints that do not affect
            cardinality.

        requirements: Description of why this constraint is necessary or appropriate.

        severity: Identifies the impact constraint violation has on the conformance of the
            instance.

        human: Text that can be used to describe the constraint in messages identifying that
            the constraint has been violated.

        expression: A [FHIRPath](fhirpath.html) expression of constraint that can be executed to
            see if this constraint is met.

        xpath: An XPath expression of constraint that can be executed to see if this
            constraint is met.

        source: A reference to the original source of the constraint, for traceability
            purposes.
