        type: Role of participant in the appointment.

        actor: A Person, Location/HealthcareService or Device that is participating in the

        required: Whether this participant is required to be present at the meeting. This covers
            a use-case where two doctors need to meet to discuss the results for a
            specific patient, and the patient is not required to be present.

        status: Participation status of the actor.

        period: Participation period of the actor.
