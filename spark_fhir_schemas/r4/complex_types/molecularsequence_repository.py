        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        type: Click and see / RESTful API / Need login to see / RESTful API with
            authentication / Other ways to see resource.

        url: URI of an external repository which contains further details about the
            genetics data.

        name: URI of an external repository which contains further details about the
            genetics data.

        datasetId: Id of the variant in this external repository. The server will understand how
            to use this id to call for more info about datasets in external repository.

        variantsetId: Id of the variantset in this external repository. The server will understand
