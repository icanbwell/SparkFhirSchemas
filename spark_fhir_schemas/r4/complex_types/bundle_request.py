        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element

        method: In a transaction or batch, this is the HTTP action to be executed for this

        url: The URL for this entry, relative to the root (the address to which the request
            is posted).

        ifNoneMatch: If the ETag values match, return a 304 Not Modified status. See the API
            documentation for ["Conditional Read"](http.html#cread).

        ifModifiedSince: Only perform the operation if the last updated date matches. See the API
