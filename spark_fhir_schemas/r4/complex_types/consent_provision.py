        A record of a healthcare consumerâ€™s  choices, which permits or denies
        identified recipient(s) or recipient role(s) to perform one or more actions
        within a given policy context, for specific purposes and periods of time.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        type: Action  to take - permit or deny - when the rule conditions are met.  Not
            permitted in root rule, required in all nested rules.

        period: The timeframe in this rule is valid.

        actor: Who or what is controlled by this rule. Use group to identify a set of actors
            by some property they share (e.g. 'admitting officers').

        action: Actions controlled by this Rule.

        securityLabel: A security label, comprised of 0..* security label fields (Privacy tags),
            which define which resources are controlled by this exception.

        purpose: The context of the activities a user is taking - why the user is accessing the
            data - that are controlled by this rule.

        class: The class of information covered by this rule. The type can be a FHIR resource
            type, a profile on a type, or a CDA document, or some other type that
            indicates what sort of information the consent relates to.

        code: If this code is found in an instance, then the rule applies.

        dataPeriod: Clinical or Operational Relevant period of time that bounds the data
            controlled by this rule.

        data: The resources controlled by this rule if specific resources are referenced.

        provision: Rules which provide exceptions to the base rule or subrules.
