        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        mode: Identifies whether this portion of the statement is describing the ability to
            initiate or receive restful operations.

        documentation: Information about the system's restful capabilities that apply across all
            applications, such as security.

        security: Information about security implementation from an interface perspective - what
            a client needs to know.

        resource: A specification of the restful capabilities of the solution for a specific
            resource type.

        interaction: A specification of restful operations supported by the system.

        searchParam: Search parameters that are supported for searching all resources for
            implementations to support and/or make use of - either references to ones
            defined in the specification, or additional ones defined for/by the
            implementation.

        operation: Definition of an operation or a named query together with its parameters and
            their meaning and type.

        compartment: An absolute URI which is a reference to the definition of a compartment that
            the system supports. The reference is to a CompartmentDefinition resource by
            its canonical URL .
