        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        mode: Identifies whether this portion of the statement is describing the ability to
            initiate or receive restful operations.

        documentation: Information about the system's restful capabilities that apply across all
            applications, such as security.

        security: Information about security implementation from an interface perspective - what
            a client needs to know.

        resource: A specification of the restful capabilities of the solution for a specific
            resource type.

        interaction: A specification of restful operations supported by the system.

        searchParam: Search parameters that are supported for searching all resources for
            implementations to support and/or make use of - either references to ones
            defined in the specification, or additional ones defined for/by the
            implementation.

        operation: Definition of an operation or a named query together with its parameters and
            their meaning and type.

        compartment: An absolute URI which is a reference to the definition of a compartment that
            the system supports. The reference is to a CompartmentDefinition resource by
            its canonical URL .
