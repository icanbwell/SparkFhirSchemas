        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        type: The type of channel to send notifications on.

        endpoint: The url that describes the actual end-point to send messages to.

        payload: The mime type to send the payload in - either application/fhir+xml, or
            application/fhir+json. If the payload is not present, then there is no payload
            in the notification, just a notification. The mime type "text/plain" may also
            be used for Email and SMS subscriptions.

        header: Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification.
