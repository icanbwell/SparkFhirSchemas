        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        location: The location where the encounter takes place.

        status: The status of the participants' presence at the specified location during the
            period specified. If the participant is no longer at the location, then the
            period will have an end date/time.

        physicalType: This will be used to specify the required levels (bed/ward/room/etc.) desired
            to be recorded to simplify either messaging or query.

        period: Time period during which the patient was present at the location.
