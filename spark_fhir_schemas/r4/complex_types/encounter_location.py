        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        location: The location where the encounter takes place.

        status: The status of the participants' presence at the specified location during the
            period specified. If the participant is no longer at the location, then the
            period will have an end date/time.

        physicalType: This will be used to specify the required levels (bed/ward/room/etc.) desired
            to be recorded to simplify either messaging or query.

        period: Time period during which the patient was present at the location.
