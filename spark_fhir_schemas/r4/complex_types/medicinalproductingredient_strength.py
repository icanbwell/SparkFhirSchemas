        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

        presentation: The quantity of substance in the unit of presentation, or in the volume (or
            mass) of the single pharmaceutical product or manufactured item.

        presentationLowLimit: A lower limit for the quantity of substance in the unit of presentation. For
            use when there is a range of strengths, this is the lower limit, with the
            presentation attribute becoming the upper limit.

        concentration: The strength per unitary volume (or mass).

        concentrationLowLimit: A lower limit for the strength per unitary volume (or mass), for when there is
            a range. The concentration attribute then becomes the upper limit.

        measurementPoint: For when strength is measured at a particular point or distance.

        country: The country or countries for which the strength range applies.

        referenceStrength: Strength expressed in terms of a reference substance.
