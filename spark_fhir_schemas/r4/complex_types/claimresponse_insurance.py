        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify insurance entries and provide a sequence of
            coverages to convey coordination of benefit order.

        focal: A flag to indicate that this Coverage is to be used for adjudication of this
            claim when set to true.

        coverage: Reference to the insurance card level information contained in the Coverage
            resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the
            patient's actual coverage within the insurer's information system.

        businessArrangement: A business agreement number established between the provider and the insurer
            for special business processing purposes.

        claimResponse: The result of the adjudication of the line items for the Coverage specified in
            this insurance.
