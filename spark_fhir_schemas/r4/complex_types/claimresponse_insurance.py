        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify insurance entries and provide a sequence of
            coverages to convey coordination of benefit order.

        focal: A flag to indicate that this Coverage is to be used for adjudication of this
            claim when set to true.

        coverage: Reference to the insurance card level information contained in the Coverage
            resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the
            patient's actual coverage within the insurer's information system.

        businessArrangement: A business agreement number established between the provider and the insurer
            for special business processing purposes.

        claimResponse: The result of the adjudication of the line items for the Coverage specified in
            this insurance.
