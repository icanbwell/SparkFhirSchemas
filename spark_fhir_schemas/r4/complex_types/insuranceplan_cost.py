        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        type: Type of cost (copay; individual cap; family cap; coinsurance; deductible).

        applicability: Whether the cost applies to in-network or out-of-network providers (in-

        qualifiers: Additional information about the cost, such as information about funding
            sources (e.g. HSA, HRA, FSA, RRA).

        value: The actual cost value. (some of the costs may be represented as percentages
            rather than currency, e.g. 10% coinsurance).
