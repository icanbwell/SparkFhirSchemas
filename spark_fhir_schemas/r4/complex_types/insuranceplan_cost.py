        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        type: Type of cost (copay; individual cap; family cap; coinsurance; deductible).

        applicability: Whether the cost applies to in-network or out-of-network providers (in-
            network; out-of-network; other).

        qualifiers: Additional information about the cost, such as information about funding
            sources (e.g. HSA, HRA, FSA, RRA).

        value: The actual cost value. (some of the costs may be represented as percentages
            rather than currency, e.g. 10% coinsurance).
