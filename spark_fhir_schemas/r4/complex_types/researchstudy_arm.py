        A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series
        of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge.  This
        includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other
        information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and
        investigative techniques.  A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of
        information about human or animal subjects.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        name: Unique, human-readable label for this arm of the study.

        type: Categorization of study arm, e.g. experimental, active comparator, placebo
            comparater.

        description: A succinct description of the path through the study that would be followed by
            a subject adhering to this arm.
