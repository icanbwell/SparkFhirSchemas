        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        path: The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path SHALL be a
            FHIRPath resolveable on the specified type of the DataRequirement, and SHALL
            consist only of identifiers, constant indexers, and .resolve(). The path is
            allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as
            indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements (see the [Simple
            FHIRPath Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details). Note that the index
            must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type code,
            Coding, or CodeableConcept.

        searchParam: A token parameter that refers to a search parameter defined on the specified
            type of the DataRequirement, and which searches on elements of type code,
            Coding, or CodeableConcept.

        valueSet: The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and code elements are additive.
            If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data items for
            which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path is a member
            of the specified valueset.

        code: The codes for the code filter. If values are given, the filter will return
            only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the
            path has a value that is one of the specified codes. If codes are specified in
            addition to a value set, the filter returns items matching a code in the value
            set or one of the specified codes.
