        subunit: Index of linear sequences of nucleic acids in order of decreasing length.
            Sequences of the same length will be ordered by molecular weight. Subunits
            that have identical sequences will be repeated and have sequential subscripts.

            letter codes. In addition to the base sequence, sugar and type of phosphate or
            non-phosphate linkage should also be captured.

        fivePrime: The nucleotide present at the 5’ terminal shall be specified based on a
            controlled vocabulary. Since the sequence is represented from the 5' to the 3'
