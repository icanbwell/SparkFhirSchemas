        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        identifier: Unique identifier for the current payment item for the referenced payable.

        predecessor: Unique identifier for the prior payment item for the referenced payable.

        type: Code to indicate the nature of the payment.

        request: A resource, such as a Claim, the evaluation of which could lead to payment.

        submitter: The party which submitted the claim or financial transaction.

        response: A resource, such as a ClaimResponse, which contains a commitment to payment.

        date: The date from the response resource containing a commitment to pay.

        responsible: A reference to the individual who is responsible for inquiries regarding the
            response and its payment.

        payee: The party which is receiving the payment.

        amount: The monetary amount allocated from the total payment to the payable.
