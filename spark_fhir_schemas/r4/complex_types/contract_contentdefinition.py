        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        type: Precusory content structure and use, i.e., a boilerplate, template,
            application for a contract such as an insurance policy or benefits under a
            program, e.g., workers compensation.

        subType: Detailed Precusory content type.

        publisher: The  individual or organization that published the Contract precursor content.

        publicationDate: The date (and optionally time) when the contract was published. The date must
            change when the business version changes and it must change if the status code
            changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the
            contract changes.

        publicationStatus: amended | appended | cancelled | disputed | entered-in-error | executable |
            executed | negotiable | offered | policy | rejected | renewed | revoked |
            resolved | terminated.

        copyright: A copyright statement relating to Contract precursor content. Copyright
            statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and publishing of the
            Contract precursor content.
