        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        status: The status code returned by processing this entry. The status SHALL start with
            a 3 digit HTTP code (e.g. 404) and may contain the standard HTTP description
            associated with the status code.

        location: The location header created by processing this operation, populated if the
            operation returns a location.

        etag: The Etag for the resource, if the operation for the entry produced a versioned
            resource (see [Resource Metadata and Versioning](http.html#versioning) and
            [Managing Resource Contention](http.html#concurrency)).

        lastModified: The date/time that the resource was modified on the server.

        outcome: An OperationOutcome containing hints and warnings produced as part of
            processing this entry in a batch or transaction.
