        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        baseFormulaType: The type of enteral or infant formula such as an adult standard formula with
            fiber or a soy-based infant formula.

        baseFormulaProductName: The product or brand name of the enteral or infant formula product such as
            "ACME Adult Standard Formula".

        additiveType: Indicates the type of modular component such as protein, carbohydrate, fat or
            fiber to be provided in addition to or mixed with the base formula.

        additiveProductName: The product or brand name of the type of modular component to be added to the
            formula.

        caloricDensity: The amount of energy (calories) that the formula should provide per specified
            volume, typically per mL or fluid oz.  For example, an infant may require a
            formula that provides 24 calories per fluid ounce or an adult may require an
            enteral formula that provides 1.5 calorie/mL.

        routeofAdministration: The route or physiological path of administration into the patient's
            gastrointestinal  tract for purposes of providing the formula feeding, e.g.
            nasogastric tube.

        administration: Formula administration instructions as structured data.  This repeating
            structure allows for changing the administration rate or volume over time for
            both bolus and continuous feeding.  An example of this would be an instruction
            to increase the rate of continuous feeding every 2 hours.

        maxVolumeToDeliver: The maximum total quantity of formula that may be administered to a subject
            over the period of time, e.g. 1440 mL over 24 hours.

        administrationInstruction: Free text formula administration, feeding instructions or additional
            instructions or information.
