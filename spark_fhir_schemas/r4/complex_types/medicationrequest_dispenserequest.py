        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        initialFill: Indicates the quantity or duration for the first dispense of the medication.

        dispenseInterval: The minimum period of time that must occur between dispenses of the
            medication.

        validityPeriod: This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the
            Prescription).

        numberOfRepeatsAllowed: An integer indicating the number of times, in addition to the original
            dispense, (aka refills or repeats) that the patient can receive the prescribed
            medication. Usage Notes: This integer does not include the original order
            dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus "3
            repeats", then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient
            can receive a total of 120 tablets.  A prescriber may explicitly say that zero
            refills are permitted after the initial dispense.

        quantity: The amount that is to be dispensed for one fill.

        expectedSupplyDuration: Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be
            used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last.

        performer: Indicates the intended dispensing Organization specified by the prescriber.
