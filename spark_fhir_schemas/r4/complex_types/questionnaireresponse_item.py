        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        linkId: The item from the Questionnaire that corresponds to this item in the
            QuestionnaireResponse resource.

        definition: A reference to an [[[ElementDefinition]]] that provides the details for the
            item.

        text: Text that is displayed above the contents of the group or as the text of the
            question being answered.

        answer: The respondent's answer(s) to the question.

        item: Questions or sub-groups nested beneath a question or group.
