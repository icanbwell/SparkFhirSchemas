        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        entity: A reference to the entity that is a member of the group. Must be consistent
            with Group.type. If the entity is another group, then the type must be the

        period: The period that the member was in the group, if known.

        inactive: A flag to indicate that the member is no longer in the group, but previously
            may have been a member.
