        The ChargeItemDefinition resource provides the properties that apply to the
        (billing) codes necessary to calculate costs and prices. The properties may
        differ largely depending on type and realm, therefore this resource gives only
        a rough structure and requires profiling for each type of billing code system.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        type: This code identifies the type of the component.

        code: A code that identifies the component. Codes may be used to differentiate
            between kinds of taxes, surcharges, discounts etc.

        factor: The factor that has been applied on the base price for calculating this
            component.

        amount: The amount calculated for this component.
