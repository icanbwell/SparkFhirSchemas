        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        code: A code - a text symbol - that uniquely identifies the concept within the code
            system.

        display: A human readable string that is the recommended default way to present this
            concept to a user.

        definition: The formal definition of the concept. The code system resource does not make
            formal definitions required, because of the prevalence of legacy systems.
            However, they are highly recommended, as without them there is no formal
            meaning associated with the concept.

        designation: Additional representations for the concept - other languages, aliases,
            specialized purposes, used for particular purposes, etc.

        property: A property value for this concept.

        concept: Defines children of a concept to produce a hierarchy of concepts. The nature
            of the relationships is variable (is-a/contains/categorizes) - see
            hierarchyMeaning.
