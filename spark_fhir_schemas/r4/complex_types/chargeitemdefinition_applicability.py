        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

        description: A brief, natural language description of the condition that effectively
            communicates the intended semantics.

        language: The media type of the language for the expression, e.g. "text/cql" for
            Clinical Query Language expressions or "text/fhirpath" for FHIRPath
            expressions.

        expression: An expression that returns true or false, indicating whether the condition is

            must be replaced at runtime with the ChargeItem resource to which this
            definition is applied.
