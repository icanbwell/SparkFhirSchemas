        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        description: A brief, natural language description of the condition that effectively

        language: The media type of the language for the expression, e.g. "text/cql" for
            Clinical Query Language expressions or "text/fhirpath" for FHIRPath
            expressions.
