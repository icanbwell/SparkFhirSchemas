        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        condition: Reason the encounter takes place, as specified using information from another
            resource. For admissions, this is the admission diagnosis. The indication will
            typically be a Condition (with other resources referenced in the
            evidence.detail), or a Procedure.

        use: Role that this diagnosis has within the encounter (e.g. admission, billing,
            discharge …).

        rank: Ranking of the diagnosis (for each role type).
