        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        subunit: Index of primary sequences of amino acids linked through peptide bonds in
            order of decreasing length. Sequences of the same length will be ordered by
            molecular weight. Subunits that have identical sequences will be repeated and
            have sequential subscripts.

        sequence: The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids from N-
            to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes. Uppercase
            shall be used for L-amino acids and lowercase for D-amino acids. Transcribed
            SubstanceProteins will always be described using the translated sequence; for
            synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are not represented with a
            single letter code an X should be used within the sequence. The modified amino
            acids will be distinguished by their position in the sequence.

        length: Length of linear sequences of amino acids contained in the subunit.

        sequenceAttachment: The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids from N-
            to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes. Uppercase
            shall be used for L-amino acids and lowercase for D-amino acids. Transcribed

            synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are not represented with a
            single letter code an X should be used within the sequence. The modified amino
            acids will be distinguished by their position in the sequence.

        nTerminalModificationId: Unique identifier for molecular fragment modification based on the ISO 11238
            Substance ID.

        nTerminalModification: The name of the fragment modified at the N-terminal of the SubstanceProtein
            shall be specified.

        cTerminalModificationId: Unique identifier for molecular fragment modification based on the ISO 11238
            Substance ID.

        cTerminalModification: The modification at the C-terminal shall be specified.
