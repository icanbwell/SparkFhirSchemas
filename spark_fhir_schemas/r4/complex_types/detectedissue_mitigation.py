        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        action: Describes the action that was taken or the observation that was made that
            reduces/eliminates the risk associated with the identified issue.

        date: Indicates when the mitigating action was documented.

        author: Identifies the practitioner who determined the mitigation and takes
            responsibility for the mitigation step occurring.
