        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        action: Describes the action that was taken or the observation that was made that
            reduces/eliminates the risk associated with the identified issue.

        date: Indicates when the mitigating action was documented.

        author: Identifies the practitioner who determined the mitigation and takes
            responsibility for the mitigation step occurring.
