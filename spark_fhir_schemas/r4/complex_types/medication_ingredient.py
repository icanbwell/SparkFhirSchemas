        itemReference: The actual ingredient - either a substance (simple ingredient) or another
            medication of a medication.

        isActive: Indication of whether this ingredient affects the therapeutic action of the
            drug.

        strength: Specifies how many (or how much) of the items there are in this Medication.
            For example, 250 mg per tablet.  This is expressed as a ratio where the
