        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        itemCodeableConcept: The actual ingredient - either a substance (simple ingredient) or another
            medication of a medication.

        itemReference: The actual ingredient - either a substance (simple ingredient) or another
            medication of a medication.

        isActive: Indication of whether this ingredient affects the therapeutic action of the
            drug.

        strength: Specifies how many (or how much) of the items there are in this Medication.
            For example, 250 mg per tablet.  This is expressed as a ratio where the
            numerator is 250mg and the denominator is 1 tablet.
