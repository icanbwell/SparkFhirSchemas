        The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on patients,
        groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from
        these. The report includes clinical context such as requesting and provider
        information, and some mix of atomic results, images, textual and coded
        interpretations, and formatted representation of diagnostic reports.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        comment: A comment about the image. Typically, this is used to provide an explanation
            for why the image is included, or to draw the viewer's attention to important
            features.

        link: Reference to the image source.
