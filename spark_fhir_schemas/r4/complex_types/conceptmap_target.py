        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        code: Identity (code or path) or the element/item that the map refers to.

        display: The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors when
            editing the concept map.

        equivalence: The equivalence between the source and target concepts (counting for the
            dependencies and products). The equivalence is read from target to source
            (e.g. the target is 'wider' than the source).

        comment: A description of status/issues in mapping that conveys additional information
            not represented in  the structured data.

        dependsOn: A set of additional dependencies for this mapping to hold. This mapping is
            only applicable if the specified element can be resolved, and it has the
            specified value.

        product: A set of additional outcomes from this mapping to other elements. To properly
            execute this mapping, the specified element must be mapped to some data
            element or source that is in context. The mapping may still be useful without
            a place for the additional data elements, but the equivalence cannot be relied
            on.
