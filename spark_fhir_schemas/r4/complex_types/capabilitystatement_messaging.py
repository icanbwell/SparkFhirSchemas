        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        endpoint: An endpoint (network accessible address) to which messages and/or replies are
            to be sent.

        reliableCache: Length if the receiver's reliable messaging cache in minutes (if a receiver)
            or how long the cache length on the receiver should be (if a sender).

        documentation: Documentation about the system's messaging capabilities for this endpoint not
            otherwise documented by the capability statement.  For example, the process
            for becoming an authorized messaging exchange partner.

        supportedMessage: References to message definitions for messages this system can send or
            receive.
