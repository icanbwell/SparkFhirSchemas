        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        value: The value of the measured amount. The value includes an implicit precision in
            the presentation of the value.

        comparator: How the value should be understood and represented - whether the actual value
            is greater or less than the stated value due to measurement issues; e.g. if
            the comparator is "<" , then the real value is < stated value.

        unit: A human-readable form of the unit.

        system: The identification of the system that provides the coded form of the unit.

        code: A computer processable form of the unit in some unit representation system.
