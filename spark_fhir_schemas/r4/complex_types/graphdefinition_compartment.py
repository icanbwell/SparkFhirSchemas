        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        use: Defines how the compartment rule is used - whether it it is used to test
            whether resources are subject to the rule, or whether it is a rule that must
            be followed.

        code: Identifies the compartment.

        rule: identical | matching | different | no-rule | custom.

        expression: Custom rule, as a FHIRPath expression.
