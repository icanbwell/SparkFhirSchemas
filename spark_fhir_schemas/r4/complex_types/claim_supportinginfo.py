        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        sequence: A number to uniquely identify supporting information entries.

        category: The general class of the information supplied: information; exception;
            accident, employment; onset, etc.

        code: System and code pertaining to the specific information regarding special
            conditions relating to the setting, treatment or patient  for which care is
            sought.

        timingDate: The date when or period to which this information refers.

        timingPeriod: The date when or period to which this information refers.

        valueBoolean: Additional data or information such as resources, documents, images etc.
            including references to the data or the actual inclusion of the data.

        valueString: Additional data or information such as resources, documents, images etc.

        valueReference: Additional data or information such as resources, documents, images etc.
