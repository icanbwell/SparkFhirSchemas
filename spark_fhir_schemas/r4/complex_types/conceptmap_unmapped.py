        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        mode: Defines which action to take if there is no match for the source concept in
            the target system designated for the group. One of 3 actions are possible: use
            the unmapped code (this is useful when doing a mapping between versions, and
            only a few codes have changed), use a fixed code (a default code), or
            alternatively, a reference to a different concept map can be provided (by
            canonical URL).

        code: The fixed code to use when the mode = 'fixed'  - all unmapped codes are mapped
            to a single fixed code.

        display: The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors when
            editing the concept map.

        url: The canonical reference to an additional ConceptMap resource instance to use
            for mapping if this ConceptMap resource contains no matching mapping for the
            source concept.
