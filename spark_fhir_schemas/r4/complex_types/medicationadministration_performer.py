        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource

        function: Distinguishes the type of involvement of the performer in the medication
            administration.

        actor: Indicates who or what performed the medication administration.
