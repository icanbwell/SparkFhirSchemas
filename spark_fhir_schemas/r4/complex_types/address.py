        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        use: The purpose of this address.

        type: Distinguishes between physical addresses (those you can visit) and mailing
            addresses (e.g. PO Boxes and care-of addresses). Most addresses are both.

        text: Specifies the entire address as it should be displayed e.g. on a postal label.
            This may be provided instead of or as well as the specific parts.

        line: This component contains the house number, apartment number, street name,
            street direction,  P.O. Box number, delivery hints, and similar address
            information.

        city: The name of the city, town, suburb, village or other community or delivery
            center.

        district: The name of the administrative area (county).

        state: Sub-unit of a country with limited sovereignty in a federally organized
            country. A code may be used if codes are in common use (e.g. US 2 letter state
            codes).

        postalCode: A postal code designating a region defined by the postal service.

        country: Country - a nation as commonly understood or generally accepted.

        period: Time period when address was/is in use.
