        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        start: The event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        addresses: Identifies problems, conditions, issues, or concerns the goal is intended to
            address.

        documentation: Didactic or other informational resources associated with the goal that
            provide further supporting information about the goal. Information resources

        target: Indicates what should be done and within what timeframe.
