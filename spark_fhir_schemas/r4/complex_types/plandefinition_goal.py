        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension

        category: Indicates a category the goal falls within.

        description: Human-readable and/or coded description of a specific desired objective of
            care, such as "control blood pressure" or "negotiate an obstacle course" or
            "dance with child at wedding".

        priority: Identifies the expected level of importance associated with
            reaching/sustaining the defined goal.

        start: The event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        addresses: Identifies problems, conditions, issues, or concerns the goal is intended to
            address.

        documentation: Didactic or other informational resources associated with the goal that
            provide further supporting information about the goal. Information resources
            can include inline text commentary and links to web resources.

        target: Indicates what should be done and within what timeframe.
