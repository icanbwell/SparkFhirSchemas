        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        reference: Where this resource is found.

        exampleBoolean: If true or a reference, indicates the resource is an example instance.  If a
            reference is present, indicates that the example is an example of the
            specified profile.

        exampleCanonical: If true or a reference, indicates the resource is an example instance.  If a
