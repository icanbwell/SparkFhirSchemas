        daysOfWeek: Indicates which days of the week are available between the start and end
            Times.

        allDay: Is this always available? (hence times are irrelevant) e.g. 24 hour service.

        availableEndTime: The closing time of day. Note: If the AllDay flag is set, then this time is
