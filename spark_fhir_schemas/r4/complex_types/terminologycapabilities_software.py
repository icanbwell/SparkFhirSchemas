        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic

            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
