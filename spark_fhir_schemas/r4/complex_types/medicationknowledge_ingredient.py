        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        itemCodeableConcept: The actual ingredient - either a substance (simple ingredient) or another
            medication.

        itemReference: The actual ingredient - either a substance (simple ingredient) or another
            medication.

        isActive: Indication of whether this ingredient affects the therapeutic action of the
            drug.

        strength: Specifies how many (or how much) of the items there are in this Medication.
            For example, 250 mg per tablet.  This is expressed as a ratio where the
            numerator is 250mg and the denominator is 1 tablet.
