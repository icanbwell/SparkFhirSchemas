        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        itemSequence: The sequence number of the line item submitted which contains the error. This
            value is omitted when the error occurs outside of the item structure.

        detailSequence: The sequence number of the detail within the line item submitted which
            contains the error. This value is omitted when the error occurs outside of the
            item structure.

        subDetailSequence: The sequence number of the sub-detail within the detail within the line item
            submitted which contains the error. This value is omitted when the error
            occurs outside of the item structure.

        code: An error code, from a specified code system, which details why the claim could
            not be adjudicated.
