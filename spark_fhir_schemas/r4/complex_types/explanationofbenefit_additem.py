        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        itemSequence: Claim items which this service line is intended to replace.

        detailSequence: The sequence number of the details within the claim item which this line is
            intended to replace.

        subDetailSequence: The sequence number of the sub-details woithin the details within the claim
            item which this line is intended to replace.

        provider: The providers who are authorized for the services rendered to the patient.

        productOrService: When the value is a group code then this item collects a set of related claim
            details, otherwise this contains the product, service, drug or other billing
            code for the item.

        modifier: Item typification or modifiers codes to convey additional context for the
            product or service.

        programCode: Identifies the program under which this may be recovered.

        servicedDate: The date or dates when the service or product was supplied, performed or
            completed.

        servicedPeriod: The date or dates when the service or product was supplied, performed or
            completed.

        locationCodeableConcept: Where the product or service was provided.

        locationAddress: Where the product or service was provided.

        locationReference: Where the product or service was provided.

        quantity: The number of repetitions of a service or product.

        unitPrice: If the item is not a group then this is the fee for the product or service,
            otherwise this is the total of the fees for the details of the group.

        factor: A real number that represents a multiplier used in determining the overall
            value of services delivered and/or goods received. The concept of a Factor
            allows for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary
            amount.

        net: The quantity times the unit price for an additional service or product or
            charge.
