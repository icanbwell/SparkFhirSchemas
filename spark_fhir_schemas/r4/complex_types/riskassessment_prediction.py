        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's

            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        outcome: One of the potential outcomes for the patient (e.g. remission, death,  a
            particular condition).

        probabilityDecimal: Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe).

        probabilityRange: Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe).

        qualitativeRisk: Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe), expressed as
            a qualitative value (e.g. low, medium, or high).

        relativeRisk: Indicates the risk for this particular subject (with their specific
            characteristics) divided by the risk of the population in general.  (Numbers
            greater than 1 = higher risk than the population, numbers less than 1 = lower
            risk.).

        whenPeriod: Indicates the period of time or age range of the subject to which the
            specified probability applies.

        whenRange: Indicates the period of time or age range of the subject to which the
            specified probability applies.

        rationale: Additional information explaining the basis for the prediction.
