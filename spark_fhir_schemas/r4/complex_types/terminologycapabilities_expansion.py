        A TerminologyCapabilities resource documents a set of capabilities (behaviors)
        of a FHIR Terminology Server that may be used as a statement of actual server
        functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation.


        id: Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This
            may be any string value that does not contain spaces.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
            in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of

            implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
            be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
            resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        hierarchical: Whether the server can return nested value sets.

        paging: Whether the server supports paging on expansion.

        incomplete: Allow request for incomplete expansions?

        parameter: Supported expansion parameter.

        textFilter: Documentation about text searching works.
