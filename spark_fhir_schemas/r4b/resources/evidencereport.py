        The EvidenceReport Resource is a specialized container for a collection of
        resources and codable concepts, adapted to support compositions of Evidence,
        EvidenceVariable, and Citation resources and related concepts.


        resourceType: This is a EvidenceReport resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this EvidenceReport when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
            canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
            address at which at which an authoritative instance of this summary is (or
            will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It
            SHALL remain the same when the summary is stored on different servers.

        status: The status of this summary. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.

        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
            that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
            or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
            may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate evidence
            report instances.

        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this EvidenceReport when it is
            represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
            or an instance.

        relatedIdentifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify things closely related to this
            EvidenceReport.

        citeAsReference: Citation Resource or display of suggested citation for this report.

        citeAsMarkdown: Citation Resource or display of suggested citation for this report.

        type: Specifies the kind of report, such as grouping of classifiers, search results,
            or human-compiled expression.

        note: Used for footnotes and annotations.

        relatedArtifact: Link, description or reference to artifact associated with the report.

        subject: Specifies the subject or focus of the report. Answers "What is this report
            about?".

        publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the evidence report.

        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
            publisher.

        author: An individiual, organization, or device primarily involved in the creation and
            maintenance of the content.

        editor: An individiual, organization, or device primarily responsible for internal
            coherence of the content.

        reviewer: An individiual, organization, or device primarily responsible for review of
            some aspect of the content.

        endorser: An individiual, organization, or device responsible for officially endorsing
            the content for use in some setting.

        relatesTo: Relationships that this composition has with other compositions or documents
            that already exist.

        section: The root of the sections that make up the composition.
