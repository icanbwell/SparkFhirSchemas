        performed).


        resourceType: This is a AdministrableProductDefinition resource

        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
            this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
            along with other profiles etc.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
            there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
            extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
            requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
            that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
            descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
            make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
            governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
            implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
            that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
            processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

            Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
            or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
            itself).

        identifier: An identifier for the administrable product.

        status: The status of this administrable product. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
            the content.

        formOf: References a product from which one or more of the constituent parts of that
            product can be prepared and used as described by this administrable product.
            If this administrable product describes the administration of a crushed
            tablet, the 'formOf' would be the product representing a distribution
            containing tablets and possibly also a cream.  This is distinct from the
            'producedFrom' which refers to the specific components of the product that are
            used in this preparation, rather than the product as a whole.

        administrableDoseForm: The dose form of the final product after necessary reconstitution or
            processing. Contrasts to the manufactured dose form (see
            ManufacturedItemDefinition). If the manufactured form was 'powder for solution
            for injection', the administrable dose form could be 'solution for injection'
            (once mixed with another item having manufactured form 'solvent for solution
            for injection').

        unitOfPresentation: The presentation type in which this item is given to a patient. e.g. for a
            spray - 'puff' (as in 'contains 100 mcg per puff'), or for a liquid - 'vial'
            (as in 'contains 5 ml per vial').

        producedFrom: Indicates the specific manufactured items that are part of the 'formOf'
            product that are used in the preparation of this specific administrable form.
            In some cases, an administrable form might use all of the items from the
            overall product (or there might only be one item), while in other cases, an
            administrable form might use only a subset of the items available in the
            overall product.  For example, an administrable form might involve combining a
            liquid and a powder available as part of an overall product, but not involve
            applying the also supplied cream.

        ingredient: The ingredients of this administrable medicinal product. This is only needed
            if the ingredients are not specified either using ManufacturedItemDefiniton
            (via AdministrableProductDefinition.producedFrom) to state which component
            items are used to make this, or using by incoming references from the
            Ingredient resource, to state in detail which substances exist within this.
            This element allows a basic coded ingredient to be used.

        device: A device that is integral to the medicinal product, in effect being considered
            as an "ingredient" of the medicinal product. This is not intended for devices
            that are just co-packaged.

        property: Characteristics e.g. a product's onset of action.

        routeOfAdministration: The path by which the product is taken into or makes contact with the body. In
            some regions this is referred to as the licenced or approved route.
            RouteOfAdministration cannot be used when the 'formOf' product already uses
            MedicinalProductDefinition.route (and vice versa).
