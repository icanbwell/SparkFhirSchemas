        category: Indicates a category the goal falls within.

        description: Human-readable and/or coded description of a specific desired objective of

            "dance with child at wedding".

        priority: Identifies the expected level of importance associated with

        start: The event after which the goal should begin being pursued.

        addresses: Identifies problems, conditions, issues, or concerns the goal is intended to

        documentation: Didactic or other informational resources associated with the goal that
